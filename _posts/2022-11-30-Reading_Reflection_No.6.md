Abigail Walker’s article, “Getting Data for Digital Humanities with APIs: A Gentle Introduction – Digital Humanities @ Pratt School of Information.”, is a didactic introduction to APIs that explains why and how they are useful in the digital humanities field. The main topics she covers include defining APIs, how they can be used in DH, how they are a wonderful resource for archiving information online, and how to use them with some example cases. 
 
This passage is largely technical and informative. Key concepts in using APIs are the Protocol (i.e. HTTPS), Base URL, Resource Path, Parameter/key-value pair, and API Key (if needed). Using these elements, specific sections of APIs can be easily accessed directly through a browser. Walker notes that within the scope of digital humanities, great places to find relevant APIs are publicly available digital libraries hosted by national and local governments, cultural organizations, and other relatively well-funded institutions. It’s important to note that since hosting and maintaining APIs require quite a bit of resources, the majority of public APIs cover information relating to institutions that have stronger monetary backings. This in it of itself limits the available fields of study in digital humanities, not unlike any other research field. 
 
Walker breaks down not only how one may use an API to search for specific information (building a query) by modifying a URL, but she also discusses potential nuances in using APIs for research on how to retrieve accurate and complete information. Constructing useful queries is the main challenge for the user. Many of the questions Walker poses highlight issues such as the range of data one would consider, how accurate the sources are, the variety of source types/mediums, who authored the sources, and many other questions pertinent to getting desired results. By posing these questions, she indicates the importance of how someone uses the data--where APIs are a tool to assist digital humanities research, and cannot necessarily determine whether or not the study results are of high quality. 
 
By considering these questions, researchers can better focus their research when working with large data sets so that their interpretations best represent the API data used. This is only an introduction to APIs; therefore, what other issues could arise when extracting data from them? If, for example, the data sampled only covered a few big cities in a country, could the data be used to summarize the overall consensus of the county itself? It must be the case then that a deeper understanding of data analysis and general data analysis experience is beneficial to have in order to effectively use the potential of APIs.
