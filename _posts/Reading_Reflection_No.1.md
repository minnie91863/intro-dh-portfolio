## Defining the Novel: Reflection on “Introduction to the Digital Humanities”


### Reading Reflection No. 1

### 11 October 2022

Gardiner, Eileen, and Ronald G. Musto. “Introduction to the Digital Humanities.” In The Digital Humanities: A Primer for Students and Scholars, 1-13. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2015.

One of the first readings discussed in this course, “Introduction to the Digital Humanities” by Eileen Gardiner and Ronald G. Musto, attempted to define the field of digital humanities. By example, the authors list a multitude of definitions across the field’s history—many of which are contradictory—and therefore indicate the vagueness and ever-changing nature of the field. 
In some instances, Digital Humanities indicates the anthropology within a digital space. This includes human interactions and information transportation through digital means like the Internet and shared digital media. Anne Burdick’s considers digital humanities to define “what it means to be a human being in the networked information age and to participate in fluid communities of practice...It is a global, trans-historical, and transmedia approach to knowledge and meaning-making”.

In other cases, academia defines the field as a branch of all Humanities in which digital data and analysis facilitates the research, analysis, and development of humanities’ information. The author themself considers digital humanities as a way of “harnessing computing power to facilitate, improve, expand and perhaps even change the way humanists work”, considering it as more of a tool to develop humanities research as a whole.
    
In each instance, however, exists a common thread of uncertainty: what are the humanities? I find it quite beautiful how the humanities are self-referencing—that the study of humanities is the study of the self in past, present, and future. Not only do we study humans in direct documentation of our experiences (first order humanities), we also study these documentations (second order humanities) and the accompanying history and logic of these studies (third order humanities).
    
The point I find the most fascinating in all of this conflict is the very human nature of differing understandings in the attempt to understand and study the self and of our histories. Relative to the lifespan of the humanities field, digital technologies have only been available for a brief period of time. While human civilization has only been present for an estimated 6,000 years, digital technologies and abstract methods of recording information have only been present for no more than a century. In the reading, the author cites a beautiful quote from the Prince of Salina from The Leopard: “Everything must change so that everything will remain the same”. We must adapt how we view ourselves to match ourselves. In what ways will we need to continue advancing to better understand humanity? Will the quantification of human studies make us “less-human”, or alternatively change the meaning of what it means to be human at all? It only makes sense that the definition of digital humanities remains contested, as we have had and will always have too little time to grasp the understanding of the field, much less ourselves.
