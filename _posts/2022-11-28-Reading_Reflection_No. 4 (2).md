The article, “Technology Is Taking Over English Departments.”, by Adam Kirsch, notes on the complicated definition, development, and future of digital humanities in academia. Kirsch focuses on the impact new forms of media and information-sharing in recent decades may have on the current and future humanities landscapes. How will new forms of information affect what would be considered and accurate, respected studies of the anthropocene? In Kirsch’s perspective, the further expansion of digital humanities is inevitable with the advancement of technology, and--while it will override the current definition of the humanities as we now understand it--will only benefit us in the field. Distant reading, for example, which involves analyzing trends present in  large datasets, would be much more efficiently conducted with the help of technology compared to what the human hand is capable of.
    
One of the major concerns Kirsch highlights  is the historically disputed and counterintuitive intersection between the natural sciences and the humanities. Rather than digital technologies replacing and completely automating humanities research, it is only useful as a tool to assist in humanities studies. Kirsch states that “if we ask the data unsophisticated or banal questions, we will get only unsophisticated and banal answers”. He considers it a mistake to view digital technologies as some kind of replacement for humanities research. Only human insight can interpret what correlations  present  in data may actually say about human activity. Kirsch opines that “the best humanistic scholarship is creative…: it draws..on a scholar’s imagination and sense of reality”. Without the experience of studying humanities, new technologies that can quantify them  lack value. 

Another idea he evaluates is a possible reason behind this discourse: the vague and novel definition of digital humanities. Since the field of digital humanities is relatively new, the institutions which fund said research hesitate to back what will be the future of the field. While some scholars consider the field as “the application of computer technology to traditional scholarly functions”, others view it as a direct representation of “a paradigm shift in the way we think about culture itself”.  The conflict comes from the power of the digital humanities in democratizing information which was previously exclusive to the publications of academic institutions. However, why gate-keep information that directly represents the very humanity that the field strives to study? It is to the institutions’ detriment if they refuse to align with the changing mediums of recorded human behavior. 
    
I agree with Kirsch in that carelessly considering digital humanities as the end-all-be-all for the future of humanities research is problematic. There is much skill and expertise required to properly interpret the information digital humanities provides. However, the power and potential of the field should not be discounted, as Kirsch supports “resist[ing]” and “critiqu[ing]” it. The most effective method of testing the advantages and limits of the field is to experiment with its potential. How can we  understand human behavior in its entirety if one does not consider our rapidly growing presence on the digital landscape.
