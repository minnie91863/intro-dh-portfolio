### Evaluation

The Plant Humanities Initiative is a digital archive of botany and it’s many historical and cultural influences. Not only does the website, the Plant Humanities Lab, function as a digital encyclopedia of plants, the resource also provides ample documentation on how certain botanicals (i.e. Aloe, Maize, and Tamarind) have influenced human civilization, migration, and our relationship to the natural environment. This project is the result of a workshop on botany and the humanities held at Dumbarton Oaks quite recently on December 2017. An advisory committee for the project, comprised of members of Dumbarton Oaks and JSTOR, maintain the information and website semiannually. The Plant Humanities Lab beta was just released this past year in March 2021, and its database will continue to grow, as its website states that its goal is to assist “researchers and students [to] construct complex and compelling narratives using state-of-the-art tools for digital writing”. To me, this goal seems pretty broad and a bit vague. 

As a digital library of human interactions with botany, this resource could assist in answering questions about why certain produce and plants are utilized today. An article I found to be interesting spoke on how peanuts were first considered as a luxury medicinal item, as noted through historical records dating back to the 1500s in the continental Americas, China, and West Africa, and are now so widely available that it’s often used in livestock feed (Peanut: From Luxury Food to Livestock Feed). Other topics in featured articles cover socially significant plants such as cinnamon, peonies, and mint.

To exercise the search functionality, I looked up one of my favorite fruits to see if it had any significant historical ties—jackfruit. Typing in the keyword “jackfruit” into the search bar produces a page consisting of its taxon name (Artocarpus heterophyllus), the name’s pronunciation, an image, and links to other resources and reference materials. I like how before searching, the search function suggests key names and topics relevant to what I put in thus far. It suggested “jackfruit wood”, “jackfruit sandwiches”, “Jackfruit Festival”, and a few other options which could be relevant if I were conducting general research on what humans may find to be important about the fruit. 

I would recommend this resource to anyone who needs to conduct relatively extensive research on specific botanicals, perhaps of a certain region, time period, or species. A helpful feature of the search function is that the website supports multiple languages ranging from Arabic to Mandarin to Bengali. Since the significance of botany on humanities extends across the entire globe, it only makes sense that so many language options are provided. From my experience, some of the sources were unable to load, which reduces the functionality of the website. I think the strength of the website lies in its simplicity and focus on humanities-related information with botany instead of the many scientific, formal definitions a typical internet search would likely produce. Thus, I’d recommend the Plant Humanities Lab over a universal search engine for humanities-specific research; however, this website is still quite  new and could definitely be improved by fixing some of the bugs in its functionality.
