He see both co\noperation and socialism as \"production for\nusei\" Thus their goals are the same, he\nreasons, although their methods are ad\nmittedly different.\nBut their goals are not the 3eno, The dif\nference is vital, especially in these\ntimes. Socialism aims at the establishment\nof an order in which r. 11 economic activity\nis planned and coitrollod by a single,\ncentral authority, either the state or some\nsimilar agency, In short, it aims at mon\nopoly? benevolent monopoly, perhaps, but\nmonopoly nevertheless.\nCooperation has no such aim. Indeed, mon\nopoly of any kind is the very opposite of\nwhat cooperatives are seeking. Coopera\ntives are established to do a job and to\ndo it better than any other form of enter\nprise can. That implies a contest--\"oomp\nitition for excellence,\" Dr, J.P. Yfarbasse\ncells it\u2014between cooperative, and non-co\npnrative business,. Socialists don't be\nlieve in that kind of contest'; they feel\nchat they know how our e'eonomy should be\norganised and that no further experimental,\ntion is necessary.\nCont. from column 1.\nFreedom is tho very essence of cooperation*\nCooper\"tivos can be established only in a\nvsociety where people are free to choose\nwhat kind of business organization they\nwant to produce *hd distribute their goods.\nTotalitarianism of any kind, whether es\ntablished by bullets or by ballots,'snuffs\n'out cooperation because it snuffs out the\nfreedom of choice. This has bdSn\u2019demwn\nstrated under all the totalitarian regimes,\n[Democratic socialists are infatuated with\n\"majority rule\"; they would have the' ma\njority. rule our economic as well as our\npolitical affairs. Today in America the\ngreat majority are voting, through their\npatronage, for non-cooDerativo business.\nIf this v\u00abte of the majority wore enforced\nupon tho country, all cooperatives would\nbe ruled out of tho picture.\nFortunetoly, the U\u00abS. Constitution sets up\no system in which majority rule is balanced\nagainst individual freedom. Political\nmatters are decidec/by majority vote, but\nthe individual, whether ha be of the ma-.\njority or of the minority, is guaranteed\nthe freedom to express himself, to assemble\nwith his follows and form voluntary organ\nizations, to own property and so on.

Isalde Back Cover\nSlate Socialism?\nHancock Warns Against Trend of Laws;\nSeeks Jobs by Rusiness Room\nNEW YORK. A warning that\nmuch of the legislation before Con\ngress tends toward state socialism\nwas sounded in an address here\nlast week by John M. Hancock,\npartner in the banking firm of\nLehman Bros, and co-author with\nBernard M. Baruch of the Baruch-\nHancock report dealing with re\nconversion of industry to a peace\ntime basis.\nHancock spoke at a dinner given\n\u25a0\n089\nin his honor by the American Man\nagement Assn, at which he received\nthe Henry Laurence Gantt Memori\nal Gold Medal \"for distinguished\nachievement in industrial manage\nment as a service to the communi\nty.\" The presentation was made by\nHarold V. Coes, chairman of the\nGantt Medal Board of Award.\n\"In the last decade,\u201d Hancock\nsaid in his acceptance address, \"we\nhave seen many steps taken in the\ndirection of a planned economy and\nstate socialism. We are asked to\naccept for ourselves what has been\ntried by -many countries in Europe\nto their own economic and social\ninjury. Didn't we fight this latest\nwar to destroy this same idea in\nthe minds of our enemies and are\nnot we now insisting in our terms\nof peace that this same idea be\nrooted out throughout the world?\n\u201cDoesn't it seem a strange\nthing that we should say that\nidea is worth a trial by us, yet\nthat is the purpose being advo\ncated in much of the legislation\nbefore Congress. Such legislation\nis frankly aimed at progress to\nward state socialism and a strong\nfederal government, something\nah ho red in America since its first\ncolony was founded.\n\"I don\u2019t believe America will go\nknowingly to state socialism. It\nmight conceivably slip into it un\nwittingly or go into it a step at a\ntime, but the pressure to do so will\nnot arise from the people generally\nor their own initiative. It will come\nfrom those who will make promises\nof its benefits for the sake of win\nning votes.\"\nHancock pointed out that state\nsocialism lends itself as a great\npolitical tool for th.e demagogue\nwho can gain votes by promoting\nthe benefits of state socialism\nwhen he isn\u2019t going to be held to\naccount for the long-range effects\nof his promises. Promises of imme\ndiate benefits will always be more\npowerful, he said, than distant\ndangers and far removed risks.\n\u201cCould it be,\" he continued, \"that\nthe idea that the government will\nguarantee jobs for all who want\nthem came directly from Nlcolay\nLenin, who pointed out many years\nago that the way to destroy our\ntype of self-government would be\nto create a public belief that gov\nernment could permanently supply\nall of the people with jobs? Lenin's\npurpose wasn\u2019t my purpose, for he\npointed out that the certain result\nwould be such a clamor for Jobs\nthat no free government coul</\nwithstand the demand and remain\nfinancially stable. And Lenin prob\nably didn\u2019t see how soft a govern\nment could be regarding pay rates,\nfor, of course, it does no good for\nthe state to guarantee a man a job\nunless it sets rates of pay and the\nkind of a job that will satisfy him\nas a voter.\"\nHancock said it is his belief\nthat the way to get more employ\nment is to proceed to get more\nemployers by inducing them to\nexpand their activities or to start\nnew businesses, either as self\nemployers or as employers of\nothers.\nHe added that this can be done\nonly by inducing men to do these\nthings and not by coercing them or\nby making it difficult for them to\nbecome employers.\n\u201cI do believe this can be done by\nany device of government planning,\nfor the inevitable tendency then is\ntoward regimentation or state so\ncialism. I think the responsibility\nof government is primarily to clear\nthe way for people to provide Jobs\nfor themselves and for employers\nto employ others, and in general to\nclear the way for people to do\ntheir own planning with reasonable\nassurance as to important govern\nment policies.\"\nDorsey Acquires\nAlabama Firm\nELBA, Ala. \u2014Dorsey Trailers, of\nElba, Ala., has acquired Utility\nTrailer Works of Montgomery, Ala.\nDorsey began building trailers in\n1932.\nDorsey\u2019s sales and service organ\nization now will service all Utility\ntrailers.\n29"}, {"title": "valley settler.", "city": ["Palmer"], "date": "19460228", "raw_text": "PALMER, ALASKA Dorothy Boll Editor St Publisher\nPublished weekly Cot the Matanuska Valley Farmers\u2019 Cooperating Association for the\npurpose of disseminating\u2019Valley News throughout the Valley and to other points\ninterested in the Valley,\nSubscription rates $1,75 per year by Mail Box $1*00 Single Copy 10gf\nDistributed through Settler Boxes\u2014Free to Co-op Members,\nA BEAM OF HOES FOR ALASKANS.\nI\nAccording to press reports from Seattle it scorns that there is hope for a long needed\nfreight adjustment on the Alaska railroad.

In other words\nsocialism has to do with government ownership. Perhaps because the government\nfinanced the beginning of the Matanuska Valley project\u2014the idea that the government\nstill'owns it is prevalent. In that case it'would be socialistic\u2014but it is not\nowned,operated or governed by the government.

The power indus\ntry, as everyone knows, is an outstanding example of\nan efficient industry that has met its public respon\nsibilities well. Advocates of government control of\nvarious projects\u2014whether state or federal\u2014generally\ntry to trump up a case based on some delinquency or\napparent failing in the industry they want to take\nover. But in the case of power, they haven\u2019t got a leg\nto stand on. There is no sound reason why private\nenterprise should be further restricted by the entrance\nof government-dominated monopolies in this or in any\nsimilar field.\u201d\nYes\u2014socialism is socialism, no matter what kind\nof government is responsible. And socialism, as mod\nern history so grimly proves, inevitably leads to com\nmunism and the destruction of all liberty\u2014civil as\nwell as economic, individual as well as corporate.\nThat\u2019s why every citizen has a personal stake in\nwhat happens at Niagara\u2014and everywhere else where\nsocialism is being urged.\n\u2014\nWHO NEEDS ANOTHER STAR?\nThree hundred scientists, meeting at the third\nannual symposium on space travel at New York\u2019s\nHayden Planetarium, were told that Russia can now\nput a \u201cred star\u201d in the sky\u2014a one-ton satellite that\nwould pass over us every few hours at a height of\n200 miles. But if we hurry, we might beat them to it,\nand shoot a 100 pound job up there by 1957 at a cost\nof a mere billion dollars.\nBut, looking around us, it would seem that we\nstill have a few chores to do down here on the ground\nfirst.\nSMALL FACTOR\nDo you ever wonder just how much of each dollar\nyou spend at retail remains in the hands of the mer\nchant in the form of profit? Various surveys indicate\nthat many consumers think that 25 percent or even\nmore does just that.\nIf you\u2019re one of them, a report of the financial\nexperience of the nation\u2019s department stores last year\nwill come as something of a surprise. Their profit,\nafter taxes, averaged 2.4 percent of their sales. In\n1952 the figure was the same.\nSome kinds of stores, dealing in staples, earn even\nless. For example, leading food chains often show\nprofits of but one cent or a trifle more on each\ndollar that crosses their counters. Retail profits are\na microscopic factor in establishing the cost of living.\n\u201cWhere people are concerned, be human, and\nwhere you deal with their money, their economy, their\ngovernment, be conservative, and don\u2019t be afraid to\nuse the word.\u201d \u2014Dwight D.

Bockmon\nThe Importance Of Words\nSouth Carolina's Strom Thur\nmond recently ran into a bit nf\ndifficulty with his Senatorial\ncolleagues when he quoted Com\nmunist leaders as having said\nsomething to the effect that so\ncialism was but the prelude to\ncommunism. None of them may\nhave said exactly what Senator\nThurmond quoted them as hav\ning said, but that does not\nmean that the communists do\nnot consider socialism the tran\nsitional existence between capi\ntalism and communism. It also\ndoes not mean that communists\nwill not do everything in their\npower to bring about socialism\nin a capitalist state.\nPerhaps the closest to an ex\nact duplication of the words\nwhich have been often quoted\nas coming from communist lead\ners are those which were writ\nten by John Strachey. a British\nradical political leader and au\nthor. Strachey said on pages\n112-113 of his The Theory and\nPractice of Socialism:\n\u201cWe also saw that it is im\npossible to establish commun\nism as the immediate successor\nto capitalism. It is accordingly\nproposed to establish socialism\nas something which we can put\nin the place of our present de\ncaying capitalism. Hence com\nmunists work for the establish\nment of socialism as a neces\nsary transition stage on the\nroad to communism.\n\u201cThis is how Lenin used, and\nStalin uses, the two words, com\nmunism and socialism. Marx,\non the other hand, called a sys\ntem of planned production for\nuse, which distributed its prod\nucts in accordance with the\nquality and quantity of the work\ndone, the first stage of com\nmunism rather than socialism.\"\nOne wonders whether the ac\ntual words used in a matter of\nthis kind are near as important\nas those who attack \u201cquota\ntions'' would make them out to\nbe. On the eve of the October\nSocialist Revolution in Russia,\nLenin wrote: \u201cAll nations will\narrive at socialism\u2014this is in\nevitable, but not all will do so\nin exactly the same way. each\nwill contribute something of its\nown in one or another form of\ndemocracy, one or another va\nriety of the dictatorship of the\nproletariat, one or another rate\nat which socialist transforma\ntions will be effected in the vari\nous aspects of social life.\u201d\nBut the contention seems to be\nthat Soviet Premier Nikita\nKhrushchev in particular has\nnever said that the way to pro\nduce a transition from capital\nism to socialism in this country\nis to infiltrate governmental cir\ncles and influence decisions\nsubtly in favor of socialism.\nKhrushchev said at the 20th\nCongress of the Communist Par\nty of the Soviet Union \"Our\nenemies like to depict us Lenin\nists as advocates of violence al\nways and everywhere. True, we\nrecognize the need for the revo\nlutionary transformation of capi\ntalist society into socialist so\nciety . . . but the forms of so\ncial revolution vary. It is not\ntrue that we regard violence\nand civil war as the only way\nto remake society.\u201d\nGus Hall, recent speaker be\nfore the John Randolph Society\nat the University of Virginia\nand recognized head of the\nCommunist Party, U. S. A., said\nin his keynote speech to the\n17th National Convention of the\nParty on December 10. 1959:\n\u201d. . . in the minds of the\nAmerican people a conflict is\ntaking place between the ideas\nof capitalism and those of so\ncialism. It touches upon every\nmajor aspect of our social life,\nand calls into question many\nprecepts which were long taken\nfor granted . . .\n\u201cThe Communist Party advo\ncates a democratic road to so\ncialism through the political and\neconomic struggles of the\nAmerican people within the de\nveloping and revitalized consti\ntutional process.\n\u201cThe Communist Party fights\nfor conditions that will lead to\na peaceful transition to social\nism because this is the prefer\nable and the least painful\nmethod . .\nIn the 1930's then Soviet Se\nAdvertisement\nSonlliside Electric Director Gets Informed on Needs of Rural \\\nirjjinians\n\\V.

Record, July 7, 1952)\nThe author, Irving Brant, is well\nknown for his definitive biography of\nJames Madison. The article is revised\nfrom remarks delivered at the Public\nAffairs Institute of the University\nof Virginia and appeared in the New\nRepublic of July 7 :\nAlong with the United States\nChamber of Commerce, the American\nMedical Association, Senator Harry\nByrd, Democrat, of Virginia, Gen\neral Eisenhower, and the Chicago\nTribune, I wish to record my solemn\nwarning against the insidious spread\nof socialism in the United States. I\nam particularly fearful of the doc\ntrines of the Ohio Socialist, Robert A.\nTaft.\nI must add at once, however, that\namong my ideological comrades I also\nhave my doubts about Dwight D.\nEisenhower. He has not succumbed to\nthe public-housing heresy of Senator\nTaft, but he has rendered himself\nsuspect by declaring in favor of Fed\neral pump priming in periods of de\npression. Pump priming is socialism.\nUnder the American way of life, you\ndon't prime a dry pump. You just\nkeep pumping, as newspaper corres\npondents do at a White House press\nconference.\nIn basic strategy Mr. Eisenhower\ndisplays the soundness one might ex\npect in a five-star general. It is ele\nmental that you cannot put socialism\ninto effect without a vast array of\npeople in Government service, and\nyou cannot keep them in service with\nout paying them. Nobody except cor\nporation executives will work for the\nGovernment for nothing, from pure\nlove of country. So, if Congress, out\nof fear of the people, is unwilling to\ntake a stand against socialistic legis\nlation, it need only abolish all ap\nand socialism will vanish.\nIKE SHOULD CONSULT PEABODY\nOn this subject Mr. Eisenhower is\nforthright even if he does not go\nfar enough. He visualizes some day\nof cutting of the Federal budget from\n$80,000,000,000 down to $30,000,\n000,000 a year. But he has not ade\nquately portrayed the monstrous evil\nthat has grown up among us. So I\ncommend to Mr. Eisenhower ex-rep\nresentative Peabody, of New Hamp\nshire, who has dealt with these Social\nist hordes. He called on Congress to\nfree the public \"from the intolerable\nburden they have for a long time\nbeen groaning and travailing under\n... in supporting legions of . . . sine\ncures who appear in swarms like lo\ncusts, upon the land of Egypt, and . . .\nare . . . rioting upon the blood and\ntreasures of the virtuous citizens (if\nany such there be) in these United\nStates . . . There is not a moment to\nbe lost in retrenching expenditures.\"\nIf Mr. Eisenhower or any other of\nmy colleagues in the fight against on\nrushing socialism desires to reproduce\nRepresentative Peabody's speech in\nfull, it was delivered on March 13,\n178.\nOur descent into socialism began\nearlier than is supposed by most\npolitical orators, editors, and doc\ntors of philosophy. To put the mat\nter in proper perspective, I pro\npose to give a short history of\nAmerican socialism, with special\nreference to the origin and early\ndevelopment of the evil.\nSocialism was introduced into\nAmerica with the invention of the\nStakhanovite system in 1754. I am\naware that the Russians claim to have\ninvented this system, but they claim\neverything. Under the Stakhanovite\nsystem, employes of the state are paid\nfor piecework\u2014at a rate which ad\nvances in geometrical instead of arith\nmetical ratio to production. An or\ndinary bricklayer js paid, say 400\nrubles a month. A Stakhanovite, lay\ning two or three times as many bricks,\nis likely to make 2,400 rubles a\nmonth, or six times as much. That\nsystem was invented in Virginia. The\nfirst Stakhanovite was George Wash\nington, who received a bounty of 15,\n000 acres of public land for enlisting\nin the French and Indian War. The\nsoldier, the non-Stakhanovite,\nreceived 400 acres, which would more\nthan satisfy the average American So\ncialist today.\nThe American Revolution gave a\ntitanic forward impulse to socialism,\npartly out of military urgency, partly\nas an auotmatic reaction to the es\ntablishment of nationhood. Because\nBenjamin Franklin put out an alm\nanac with some pious adages in it\nabout thrift, he is thought of as a de\nfender of free enterprise. In reality,\nFranklin was our first socialist bu\nreaucrat\u2014the first American Post\nmaster General. From the humble\nstart thus made in socialism, we have\ndeveloped the mighty postoffice ma\nchine, with a deficit of a billion dol\nlars a year.\nLet us glance at some of the so\ncialistic activities which are most\nalarming today.\nFederal aid to education: This mon\nstrosity began in 1775, when the\nContinental Congress voted funds\nto pay for the education of Indian\nyouths at Dartmouth College. It was\nextended to white boys and girls in\n1787, when Congress appropriated\n1 square mile in every township of\nthe Northwest Territory for support\nof free public schools.\nNationalization of industry: This\nfrightful evil started in 1777, when\nCongress established public tanning\nyards to make leather for shoesi and\nharnesses.\nFederal construction and operation\nof transportation systems: This dates\nfrom 1779, when Congress established\na ferry on the Delaware River and\nauthorized the building of a highway\nacross Maine, from the Penobscot\nRiver to Nova Scotia, in order to\nUnited States.\nGovernment in the banking busi\nness: This began in 1780, when Con\ngress guaranteed the Bank of Pen\nnsylvania against \"all deficiencies of\nlosses and expenses.\" Since the Gov\nernment only guaranteed the bank\nagainst losses, and did not share in\nprofits, some people may say that this\nwas not really socialism\u2014-it was a\nlegitimate feature of the system of\nfree enterprise. But wait\u2014that Bank\nof Pennsylvania was a nonprofit as\nsociation. I hesitate to stress this\npoint realizing that it might set a\nprecedent for absorbing the losses\nof all co-operative institutions. But\ntruth is truth, and must be told,\nwherefore I add another exhibit\u2014the\nsetting up, in 1782, of the Bank of\nNorth America under Federal charter,\nwith the United States Treasury sub\nscribing one-half of the capital\nstock.\nGovernment control of agriculture:\nLook in the index to Henning's Sta\ntutes of Virginia for 1782-84 and\nread the 170 subject headings which\nfill seven columns on the regulation\nof tobacco production and marketing.\nClearly those Virginia Socialists were\nhardened despots. Section 36 of the\ntobacco code reads: \"And be it fur\nther enacted. That if any inspector,\nor inspectors, shall . . . issue . . . more\nthan one receipt for any hogshead or\ncask of tobacco . . . such inspector or\ninspectors, being thereof convicted\nby due course of law, shall . . . suf\nfer death . . . without benefit of\nclergy.\"\nSocial security: Aside from military\nbounties, the beginning of this alarm\ning trend lies somewhere before Sep\ntember 15, 1787, when James Madi\nson said in the Constitutional Con\nvention, \"that there were other uses\nfor tonnage taxes, as the support of\nseamen, etc.\" The line is straight and\nshort from that to the Roos\u00e9velt\nWagner Social Security Act.\nI come now to the saddest story of\nall\u2014the origin of socialized medicine.\nThis occurred in 1813, when Congress\nfinanced the distribution of small\npox vaccine throughout the country.\nIt is more distressing because this\nunconstitutional measure was spon\nsored by President Madison, the fa\nther of the Constitution.\nSo far, I have limited myself to de\ntailed features of socialism which\nwere enacted into law in the early\ndays of our Republic. Let us consider\nbroader aspects of the nefarious pro\ngram. How many of you are familiar\nwith this plank in the American So\ncialist platform?\n\"All the precious metals should\nabsolutely be the property of the\nFederal Government.\"\nNotice the ruthlessness of that\nword \"absolutely,\" the disregard of\nprivate-property rights, the arrogant\nassumption that the Federal Govern\nment, rather than the States should\npossess this vast resource. This last\nfeature isn't really surprising, how\never, when you conider who wrote\nthose words\u2014Alexander Hamilton.\nAs Representative Peabody said,\n\"There is not a moment to be lost.\"\nIf, as I hope, there are representa\ntives of American patriotic societies\namong my readers, I urge them to act\nat once. The least that can be done\nis to remove Hamilton's works from\nhigh school libraries.

Mr. Steffansson is well\nknown to many other Montana peo\nple, not only because of his renown\nas an Arctic explorer but because of\nlecture tours made thru this state\nin later life.

C. and apparently somewhat\nequivalent to our common expressions\n\"lands end\", \"the jumping off place\"\nor \"boundary of habitable earth\". Un\nder this title the author presents both\npro and con evidence on three geo\ngraphic questions that still disturb\nminds and keep pens moving on the\npart of hundreds of scholarly scien\ntists and writers. He does not at\ntempt to answer the questions but\ncites evidence both ways and lets\nthe reader decide, if he can. The\nquestions are:\n1. Did a Greek named Pytheas\ndiscover Iceland about 325 B. C.\n2. Did Columbus visit Iceland ten\nor a dozen years before his discov\nery of the West Indias in 1492.\n3. Is the Arctic region so cold\nand snow bound as to be uninhabi\ntable, as our school books generally\nteach, or is it very much less rigorous\nthan reported and capable of support\ning a considerable population.\nBy what must have been a vast\namount of research Mr. Steffansson\nhas dug up evidence that shows these\nquestions, stretching over more than\n2200 years of time, to be quite init\nmately related. This is true because\nduring the dark ages in Europe and\nfor a long time after the famous voy\nage of Columbus, warring powers\nmade it a practice to destroy op\nposition books and records. In mat\nters of exploration there is little left\nto tell just what did happen. Sec\nondly the thinking of much of the\nworld is still being influenced by\nGreek philosophy that was developed\nand put into circulation about four\nor five hundred years B. C.\nPrior to 400 B. C. the Greeks had\ndefeated the Persians and become a\nleading nation. Greek philosophers\nhad determined that the world is\nround and divided it into five zones,\nsimilar to the zones we know today.\nBy observation of the angles at which\nsun rays strike the earth at various\nlatitudes they had computed that the\ntwo temperate zones are habitable,\ntwo arctic zones are too cold for\nlife, while the torrid zone must be so\nhot it could not be crossed. Since\nthe then known world consisted only\n(Continued on Paee Two)\ncreeping socialism that resides in the\ntaxing power and in profit sharing.\nNotice the similarity between Hamil\nton's position and that of the Su\npreme Court and President Truman\non the national ownership and ex\nploitation of tidelands oil. Need We\nbe surprised that the Stakhanovite\nPresident, George Washington, ap\npointed the socialist Alexander Ham\nilton to his Cabinet? We may, how\never, feel sure of one thing: No man\nwho wrote the words I have just\nquoted would ever be confirmed as\nSecretary of the Treasury by the\npresent United States Senate.\nFortunately, not all the messages\nfrom the past are those of bolshevist\ndestruction. Even though the father\nof the Constitution set us on the\ntrail, to social security and socialized\nmedicine, James Madison was a vali\nant and consistent defender of pri\nvate-property rights.

The evils of political fac\ntion, Madison wrote, could be com\nbatted: \"By silent operation of laws,\nwhich, without violating the rights of\nproperty, reduce extreme wealth to\nward a state of mediocrity, and raise\nextreme indigence toward a state of\ncomfort.\nA Socialist might read that and\nsay there was a fly in the ointment.\nI read it and perceive some ointment\namid the flies.

Are the latter's sel\nfish propaganda and obstruction cost\nowners hundreds of millions\nmg car\nof dollars, and scandalously wasting\nnational resource which is vitally\nimportant in peace and war?\nThe answer to those questions is\n\"Yes,\" according to a startling story\nin the June issue of \"True,\ntional magazine, and further informa\ntion dug up by the writer of the ar\nticle you are now reading.\n\"If you drive a car,\" the magazine\nstory says, \"the chances are you're\na gullible partner in one of the most\nappalling wastages of a national re\na\na na\nsource.\nLOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO\nSWINDLE YOU\n\"Every time the mileage meter on\nyour car rolls up another 1,000 or\nmaybe 2,000 miles, you go looking\nfor somebody to swindle you. You al\nways find him. You're wasting this\nvital resource, It's OIL.\n\"You go to a filling station and\nsay to the man: 'Change the oil.'\nYou pay him and drive away as hap\npy as any man who ever bought a\ngold brick.\nWhat happens to the oil which was\ndrained out of your crankcase? The\nmagazine says the filling station man\nusually throws it away or sells it\ncheap to \"someone who wants to use\nit for keeping down dust on country\nroads or driveways.\nActually, the magazine says, citing\nmany scientific authorities, oil never\nwears out. \"For normal driving in a\ntemporate climate, if you have a good\nfilter, you need change your oil no\noftener than every 8,000 to 10,000\nmiles.\" You could use the same oil\nforever if were not for this reason:\n\"Small quantities of gasoline may\nsweep into your oil and dilute it.\nSometimes this, and some constitu\nents of the original (new) oil, are\ntransformed into acids. Dilution and\nacidity can eventually grow to pro\n' *\n' '\nportions which do lessen lubricating\nefficiency.\nThat's where the process of re\nrefining oil comes in.\"\nAbout 30 years ago, the magazine\nsays, a few men began collecting used\noil from filling stations, and\nrefining\" It. At first, their processes\nwere crude and the product not al\nways good. But, as time went on, re\nrefining companies developed and\nused processes as efficient as those\nused by the companies producing new\n*.\nre\noil.\nRE-REFINED CRANKCASE OIL\nIS BETTER\nThe magazine quotes scientific and\ngovernment authorities as saying re\nrefined oil is even better than new\noil, because the former is \"triple-re\nfined\"\u2014once when it was first pro\nduced, again by the heat and pressure\nin the car engine, and a third time\nby the \"re-refiner.\" As a result, it\ncontains less impurities than new oil\ndoes.\nThe magazine says re-refined oil\nis used by \"the U.

Some Grey\nhound oil has been lubricating en\ngines for as much as 200,000 miles.\"\nWhy, if these large organizations\nuse re-refined oil, and it is cheaper\nthan new oil \u00bbhaven't more motorists\ndiscovered it and turned to it? Be\ncause, the magazine says, the big oil\ncompanies, which profit by sellng new\noil and scaring motorists into chang\ning often, put all sorts of obstacles\nin the path of the re-refiners. These\nobstacles include legislation pushed\nin Congress and state legislatures by\nthe powerful \"Oil Trust Lobby.\"\nThe magazine gives credit to the\nAir Force as the only one of the\narmed forces which defied the Lobby,\nsaves huge sums by re-refining its oil\nand using it over and over again,\nand thus prevents waste of a vital\nnational resource.\nThe magazine names a few men in\nother government agencies, who\nshowed courage by insisting on tell\ning the truth\nBut it points to more government\nagencies and officials who yielded to\nthe Lobby and helped block the re\nrefining of oil.\nOIL DOES NOT WEAR OUT\nIn one case, which the magazine\ndid not mention, re-refiners pleaded\nwith the Navy for a chance to dem\nonstrate the worth of their process\nand product on the Navy's own terms.\nJust give us. some of the used oil\nyou are throwing away,\" they told\nthe admirals. \"Send your own offi\ncers and engineers to watch us re\nrefine that oil, and have your scien\ntists test our product both in the\nlaboratory and practical use.\nThe admirals \"stalled\" for months\nand finally turned down that wide\nopen offer. Were they serving Uncle\nSam or the \"Oil Trust Lobby\"?\n((\n\u2022 I\nIn another case not mentioned by\nthe magazine, government purchas\ning officials prepared and began to\npublish a report saying that oil does\nnot wear out and could be used prac\ntically forever. The Lobby \"put on\nthe pressure,\" the report was hastily\nwithdrawn from publication, and it is\nalmost impossible to find a copy of\nit now.\nAbout 10 years ago, in another case\nnot mentioned by the magazine, one\nof the Ohio Farm Bureau's \"co-op\"\norganizations had Ohio State Uni\nversity scientists conduct exhaustive\ntests on oil. They reported that it's\nsilly to change motor oil every 1,000\nmiles, because oil doesn't wear out,\nthough it does get \"dirty\" and ulti\nmately needs re-refining. That report\ndidn't get much notice in daily news\npapers, which don't like to offend big\nadvertisers like the oil companies.\n\"In the middle of this controversy,\"\nthe magazine says, \"is the motorist,\nwho pays and pays needlessly for oil\nchanges and seldom is offered a\nchance to buy back his good oil. In\nareas where he can do so, he saves\nmoney\u2014re-refined oil sells at 25 to\n30 cents a quart, compared to 35 to\n40 cents for new oil. Where he can\nnot do so, he can hasten the day\nof his liberation by asking his filling\nstation to carry it.\n\"Meanwhile, what can you, the\naverage motorist, do about new oil?\nYou can keep it in your car much\nlonger than you're probably ac\ncustomed to.\""}, {"title": "voice.", "city": ["Lincoln"], "date": "19470717", "raw_text": "CHURCHES\nAllon Chapel\n(Seventh-Day Adventist)\nUrban League\u20142030 \u201cT\u201d Street\nFrank W.

E. B. DuBois.\nDr. DuBois was speaking at an\ninstructive meeting of the recent\nNAACP convention on his first\npublic appearance since his re\nturn to the organization two years\nago. He is one of the founders of\nNAACP.\nAdvising an understanding of\nsocialism, the noted editor and\neducator declared that there was\n\u201cno cause for alarm at charges of\nbeing a Communist if the aim was\nthe abolition of world poverty.\u201d *\nHe pointed out that poverty\nwas \u201cunnecessary\u201d, that the col\nonies, \u201cquasi - colonial regions\u201d\nand the American south were the\nmost poverty stricken portions on\nearth.

After\nthat census enumerators\u2014during\n. the national canvass in 1940 and\nthe sample survey in 1947\u2014sought\nto determine the \u2018\u2018degree of educa\ntion\u201d rather than the ability to read\nand write.\nThus, no exactly comparable to\ntals are available to show the trend\nin illiteracy from 1870, when the\nwhole population was first polled\non the question, through the last\ngeneral census in 1940 and the spot\ncheck last year.\nFewer Since 1930\nCensus experts estimate, however,\nthat there are fewer illiterates in\nthe United States now than in 1930.\nwhen 4.3 per cent of the population\nover 10 years of age, or 4.283,753\npersons, were classified as unable\nto read and write.\nThe War Department's experience\nwith illiterates resulted in the estab\nlishment of a naw classification\u2014\n\u201cthe functional illiterate.\u201d or the\nman who had not progressed beyond\nthe fourth grade in school and was\nrated mcapaoie oi iunctiomng wnn\nfull efficiency as a soldier because\nhe could not read and understand\nbasic orders and instructions.\nIn this borderline classification of\nthose who had some formal school\ning but not enough to compete on\nan equal footing with average sol\ndiers or civilians are some 6,000.000\npersons, census experts estimate.\nThe heavy percentage of illiterates\nand functional illiterates, as revealed\nby many census counts and the\nrecent spot check, remains in South\neastern States, which have the\nlargest colored populations.\nIn 1940. for example, the per\ncentage of those over 25, who had\ncompleted less than five years of\nschooling, was 35.7 in Louisiana,\n34 7 in South Carolina. 30.2 in\nMississippi, 30.1 in Georgia, 28.9 in\nAlabama, 27.3 in New Mexico, 26.2\nin North Carolina and 23.2 in Vir\nginia.

He concluded that\nsocialism came not to destroy but\nto fulfill western culture, derived\nfrom Greece, Rome and Judea. Its\nmethods would be peaceful. It\nwould seek progress through evolu\ntion and not revolution. The par\nliamentary system would be re\ntained. Resort would be to ballots\ninstead of bullets. And socialism\nwould never take orders from Mos\ncow.\nSince ine essential program oi\nsocialism is economic, it was op\nposed by the Vatican as \"material\nistic.\u201d Christian socialism was or\nganized, under religious leaders, as\na rival of secular socialism, with\nthe object of weakening its in- [\nfluence in political parties and\nlabor unions. A spiritual basis was\nsought in love of mankind and the\nfatherhood of God. Recently the\nHoly See has established a working\narrangement with moderate, right\nwing socialism. In many respects\ntheir economic teachings have\ngrown similar.\nTo ft scholar like Blum com\nmunism is a \"heresy\u201d of socialism.\nHe has compared it to the revolt of\nIslam against Catholic civilization.\nIt was founded in a manifesto pub- j\nlished during 1848 by Karl Marx\nand Friedrich Engels.

Josef Stalin re\nverted to the only sort of rule his\ncountrymen had ever known.

In\norder to understand what these\naccusations imply, it is necessary\nto glance briefly at fascism and\nnational socialism. They are ofli\ncially dead, but persist underground,\nwith more or less vitality, in Italy\nand Germany. Their principles, ac\ncording to the Russians, are spread\ning apace among the democracies.\nBoth creeds are opposed to Marx\nism and the proletariat on the one\nhand, and to the bourgeoisie and\ncapitalism on the other. They dif\nfered from communism in two out\nstanding respects. The \"leadership\nprinciple\u201d was elevated into a per\nmanent factor by fascism and na\ntional socialism. In theory, at\nleast, the Communist dictatorship\nis a temporary measure, until the\nmasses are trained to be worthy of\npolitical freedom and civil privileges.\nCommunism, again in theory, is in\nternational. Both Hitler and Benito\nMussolini declared that their sys\ntems were not exportable.\nThe central principle of fascism\nwas its adoration of war. The\ntenets of its creed were love of\naudacity and danger, pf strength,\ncourage and resolution; and devo\ntion and sacrifice for the nation.\nMussolini declared all life to bs\n\"an education for combat.\u201d and\npronounced that \u201cwar is to the man\nwhat maternity is to the woman.\"\nHe insisted on Darwin\u2019s \"iron law\nof nature,\u201d which makes the strong\nprevail over the weak. From the\nbeginning, fascism was an impla\ncable enemy of democracy and the\nrights of man.\nNational socialism was a whole\nsale borrower. Its youth movement\nwas copied from the Catholic\nchurch and its \"Herrenvolk\" theory\nfrom the \u201cChosen People\" of the\nJews. From communism it took\nLenin's \"revolutionary technique\u201d\nand the Russian method of sup\nporting power by means of terror\nism, political police and cells of\ninformers in -every block.

One\nwas the martial cult. The other\nwas the establishment of an all\npowerful state, under a chief se\nlected by destiny, with abject obedi\nence as the supreme virtue of the\nmasses. Hitler's original and sin\nister contribution was the Nazi\nracist theory, demanding the ex\ntermination or enslavement of \u2018\u2018sub\nhuman\u2019\u2019 species of mankind. These\nwere defined as Jews, Slavs and\ngypsies.\nCarbon Copy of Fascism\nOut of their hatred for \u201cmaterial\nistic'' communism, Mussolini and\nHitler pretended for their move\nments a lofty spiritual foundation.\nMost men have Judged its origin to\nhave been infernal rather than di\nvine. The claim has been stated\nthus: \u201cIn the modem world, sordid\nand commercial, fascism and na\ntional socialism represented perhaps\nthe last stand of the heroic prin\nciple.\u201d\nFalangism was a Spanish carbon\ncopy of fascism. It was never a\n;ontrolling factor in the Franco gov\nernment. especially after the dis\nmissal of its leader, Serrano Suner,\nas Foreign Minister. Gen. Franco\nhoped the Axis would win and de\nstroy communism, but he hoped far\nmore passionately to keep Spain out\nof the war. He prevented Hitler\nfrom taking Gibraltar and becoming\nmaster of the Mediterranean, and\nheld quiet 150,000 troops in Spanish\nMorocco which could have stabbed\nthe North African invasion in the\nback.\nThe \u201ccorporative state was in\nvented by Mussolini and has a sur\nvival in Portugal.

It wages\nno quarrel with democracy and the\nbill of rights. \u2022 Public ownership, it\nholds, should be gradual and selec\ntive. But there are economists who\nargue that socialism cannot work,\nin the long run, without govern\nment control of wages, prices, pro\nduction, distribution of raw ma\nterials and assignment of labor.\nSocial Democracy Rules\nSocial democracy rules in Bel\ngium, Holland, Denmark, Norway\nand Sweden, and is in joint con\ntrol of Prance. In all but name it\nis sovereign in Great Britain. It is\npowerful in Western Germany.\nChristian socialism has captured\nItaly and partly rules France. Its\npolitical parties and labor unions\ndraw spiritual breath from the\nCatholic church and economic pre\ncepts from the great philosopher of\ncompromise, St. Thomas Aquinas.\nThe chief difference between secular\nand Christian socialism is that the\nlatter holds tenaciously to private\nownership and private enterprise\u2014\ninsofar as they do not menace the\npublic weal.\nIn American parlance, a liberal\nis a progressive who stands at the\nleft of center between the con\nservative and radical. One would\nhave been in error if the same\nmeaning had been applied to the\nLiberal Party of Italy which figured\nin the April election. Liberalism,\nin the European sense, means ad\nherence to the Manchester school\nof economic thought, which clings\nto Adam Smith, the doctrine of\nlaissez faire and untrammeled indi\nvidualism.\nThus, before American eyes, Eu\nrope has spread a great variety of\nsocial organisms. Certain of them\nhave perished and others have tri\numphed. Still others are struggling\nin the experimental stage.

Everybody almost who has\nany wealth.

Strebig\nBecause a tremendous air cargo\nfleet will be needed In any future\nwar, military and civilan transport\nexperts have been wrestling with the\nproblems of an adequate peacetime\nreserve pool.\nThus far they have not announced\na figure as finally accepted, but\ntestimony before the President\u2019s Air\nPolicy Commission indicated 4,000 or\n5.000 transport planes are desirable.\nI The entire American transport fleet\nin scheduled operations now is about\n1.000 aircraft.\nThe military interest is primarily\nI in a long-range, four-engine plane\nat least as large as the Douglas DC\n6 or the Lockheed Constellation. The\ninitial cost of a fleet of 4,000 planes\nof that sine would be well over $4,\n000,000,000. The annual operat\ning cost would be several billion\ndollars more if the planes were kept\nbusy.\nWant Large Carrier\nAssuming the planes were flown\nan average of eight hours a day five\ndays a week, with 1 in . 10 on the\nground for maintenance, the avail\nable lift capacity would be 33,000,\n000,000 ton-miles a year. A ton\nmile means the movement of 2,000\npounds one mile.\nThat is more than 60 times as\nmuch air cargo as was carried by\nUnited States air operators last year\nand four times as much as the less\nthan-carlot freight carried by rail.\nIt is 15 or 20 times as much lift as\nGovernment experts have estimated\nmight be needed for air freight\nneeds in 1050.\nA 4,000-plane fleet flying 40 hours\na week would bum 2,750,000,000\ngallons of gasoline a year, or 10\ntimes as much as this country's air\nlines used last year. In the face of\na threatened petroleum shortage, the\nextra burden would be unwelcome.\nThe Civil Aeronautics Board told\nthe President\u2019s commission that a\nj 1,000-plane cargo fleet could handle\n! 4,700 times as much cargo as was\n| carried in 1946 by the existing com\nmercial fleet, mostly passenger\nplanes. The operating cost would be\n\"virtually prohibitive,\u201d the board\nsaid.\nBut in the face of that, several\nwitnesses suggested the need of 5,000\ntransport planes as an operating\nreserve for military emergency\n! needs. (To the military a \"trans\nj port plane\u201d is one that can double\nj as a cargo or troop carrier.)\nThose witnesses included Vice Ad\n; miral E. S. Land, president of the\niAir Transport Association; C. R.\nSmith, chairman of American Air\nlines and wartime deputy chief of\nthe Air Transport Command, and\nCapt. C. H. Schildhauer, former\nNaval Air Transport Service offi\ncial.\nOthers Conservative\nMost airline officials were inclined\nto be more conservative, with sug\ngestions of 200 to 500 planes in the\nreserve pool.\nWhen the Japs struck, the Na\ntion\u2019s domestic air fleet was about\n365 planes. The military took half\nof them as the nucleus for organiz\ning its own air transport services.\nEventually about 16,000 transports\n| of 25,000 pounds or more gross\nweight were built for the military.\nThe Military Air Transport Serv\nice (MATS), which does all of the\nhauling for the Army, Air Force\nand Navy, operates only 300 planes\nI in transport service today. That!\n| wouldn\u2019t be a start toward wartime \u25a0\nneeds. j\nTwo problems arise in having\ntransports ready in sufficient quan\ntity for initial demands: (1) De\nsign of a plane usable by civil\noperators pending its call to mili\ntary service and (2) keeping the\nfleet modern.\nWeight Kills Utility\nThe first is a problem because\nmilitary transports require \u201cbeef-|\ning up\u201d beyond civil needs. Thej\nFairchild C-82 Packet is an example.\nIt has 3,000 pounds of weight built\ninto it solely to meet Air Force de\nmands.

This was on\nthe same principle which had\nprompted President Truman to ask\nCongress for money for Turkey and\nGreece in March, 1947, and which\nhad impelled Gen. Marshall to call\nfor $5,300,000,000 for the 16 West\nern European nations\u2014and the\nwestern zones of Germany\u2014during\nthe next 12 months.\nThe underlying reason for this\nvast expenditure for Europe\u2014which\nGen. Marshall has termed a \"cal\nculated risk\u201d\u2014was the substantiated\nbelief that American aid in the\neconomic recovery of the countries\nIn Russia\u2019s path\u2014and, if necessary,\npolitical and military backing as\nwell\u2014was the best answer to Mos\ncow\u2019s expansionist drive.\nYet, what is sauce for the goo6e\napparently is not sauce for the\ngander.\nSecret Memo Read\nIn a secret memorandum sent to\nCongress on June 12 the Secretary\nof State formally opposed throwing\nthe American taxpayers\u2019 good\nmoney down the Chinese \"rathole.\u201d\nWitnesses for the Government,\nIncluding Army Secretary Royall,\ntestified in executive sessions that\nmembers of Congress have the priv\nilege of appropriating money for\nwhomever they choose. But, he said,\nthe considered opinion of the ad\nministration was that China In\nevitably would be taken over by the\nCommunists, and any interference\nby this Government not only would\ncost money, but also would affect\ngreatly our prestige in Asia.\nSome military experts, who until\nrecently were strong advocates of\naiding Nanking, have changed their\nviews, reportedly under instructions\nfrom higher up. The White House\nItself, which in the past was strong\nly in favor of helping China to\nprevent establishment of a Soviet\nsponsored government over its 400,\n300,000 people, now has veered to\nGen. Marshall\u2019s view.\nRoyall Unsuccessful\nSince the Secretary of State, whose\nsrestige with the Chief Executive\ns greater than that of any other\ncabinet officer, was so determined\n\u25a0o see all assistance withdrawn from\nGeneralissimo Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s\njovernment, Mr. Royall was desig\nnated to torpedo the measure in\nCongress\u2014presumably with little\nsuccess.\nThe vast majority of American\npeople pay little attention to Asia,\nwhich is twice as far from this\ncountry as Europe. In the first\nplace, most of us are descendants\n>f immigrants from Europe. We\nenow that 80 per cent of China\u2019s\nmillion^ are illiterate. We hear a\njreat deal about corruption and un\nreliability of officials. Our public:\n\u00bblso has been accustomed to read\npnly spectacular news from China.\nBut today China is vitally important\nfrom the strategic angle.\nMacArthur\u2019* Views\nGen. MacArthur, who admittedly\nis our foremost expert on Far Eait\n\u00bbm military problems, communi\ncated his views to certain Important\npersons after he turned down the\nnvitation of the Senate Appropria\n;ions Committee to testify in con\nlection with the European Recovery\nProgram. He emphasized without\nqualification that the preservation\n>f China outside the Russian orbit\nwas one of this country\u2019s essential\nstrategic moves.\nThe general\u2019s Job in Japan is\npractically completed. But the\nlewly established Japanese democ\nracy cannot survive unless China's\nsovereignty is preserved. From the\neconomic point of view she cannot\nexist in years to come without con\ntinually sponging on the United\nStates, unless she has access to\nChina's economic resources, prin\ncipally in Manchuria.\nAn economic agreement between\nthe Tokyo and Nanking govern\nments can be reached after a peace\ntreaty with Japan has been signed.\nBut if the major portions of China\nfall to the Communists, Japan will\nhave to deal with a Moscow-spon\nsored and controlled government\nwhose price for those raw materials\nwill be the political subjection of\nJapan to the Moscow masters.\nGen. MacArthur is said to have\ni Truman Trip Develops Pattern\n(Continued From Page C-l.)\nname of Gen. Elsenhower comes up.\nbut that is about all.\ni Seemingly, most attention is be\ning given to the winner of the Re\n' publican draw in the minds of Dem\n\u25a0ocrats. This was particularly true\nin California, where Gov. Earl War\nren is a candidate for the Repub\nlican nomination.\n| Mr. Truman singled out Gov.\n; Vt arren for warm praise in a rear\n| platform speech at Sacramento,\nadding that \u201che really is a Demo\ncrat, and doesn\u2019t know it.\u201d\nThis might have been the tipofT\non the way in which the President\nwill handle the Californian' if he\ncorrfrs up with the Republican nomi\nnation.\nRead along with his Oregon crack\nabout \"Old Joe\u201d Stalin as \u201cprisoner.\n' of the Politburo,\" it is possible that!\nthe President is looking forward to\nthe day when he ir?v be campaign\ning against a man w_ \u2019i whom he is\nfriendly, personally, and against\nwhom the fight would be waged\npurely on the basis o^ party t:mp,\nwith the GOP figuring as this coun\ntry\u2019s politburo.\nThe President came out of the\nWest satisfied with results, and even\nJames Roosevelt, Democratic State\nchairman of California, who does\nnot rate as a Truman supporter, de\nclared Mr. Truman \u2018\u2018very definitely\u201d\nhad served the party well by laying\nit on the Republicans.\nThe President on several occasions\nhas said he has no fear of the out\ncome once the people understand\nthe record.\nHe probably summed up his ap\nproach to the whole matter to a\nback-platform gathering in Wins\nlow, Arts. ,\n\u201cYou know,\u201d he said, \"the greatest\nepitaph In the country is here in\nArizona. It\u2019s in Tombstone, Ariz.,\nand this epitaph says: \u2018Here lies\nJack Williams. He done his\ndamndest.' I think that is the\ngreatest epitaph a man could have.\nWhatever a man does the best he\ncan, then that is all he can do; and\nthat is what your President has\nbeen toying to do for the last three\nyears for this country^\u2019 j\npointed out that strategically tha\nsurvival of the Chinese National\ngovernment is even more important.\nIn the event of war with Russia\nour position would be seriously im\npaired if the (Jommunlsts rule in\nNanking.\nFears Another Bataan\nJapan Is within easy reach of\nbombers flown from Chinese air\nfields and we might be faced with\nanother Bataan In the Japanese\nislands. From the standpoint of\nlong-range policy, our position In\nthe Pacific would become seriously\njeopardized if, after we leave Japan,\nthe Soviet government is able, by\neconomic means and subversive in\nfiltration, to coerce that country\nto place itself under Soviet domi\nnation.\nGen. MacArthur\u2019s summation\nis said to have been that China\nmust be helped with every available\nmeans from falling into the hands\nof the Communists. If Washington\nwere Inclined to help the Chinese,\nthe expenditure would be relatively\nsmall. There are Important quanti\nties of war materials In Japan\ntoday which are practically useless\nto American armed forces but these\nhave not yet been declared surplus\nand consequently cannot be sold or\ngiven to the Chinese.\nIt is logical to believe that Secre\ntary Marshall, who was an able\nChief of Staff of the Army before\nand during the war, would be able\nto see the situation in the same\nlight as his colleague in Tokyo.\nStrangely enough, this is not the\ncase.\nAfter the war, when most other\nfive-star generals and admirals re\ntired or accepted less burdensome\njobs, Gen. Marshall accepted one of\nthe most thankless tasks any one\ncould have wished on a man of his\ntype. In response to President Tru\nman's pressing request he accepted\nthe position of special Ambassador\nto China with the purpose of recon\nciling the Nationalists and the\nCommunists and persuading them to\nwork together In a unified govern\nment.\nGen. Marshall had acquired polit\nical knowledge about China from\nthe personal reports of his old\nfriend, Gen. Stllwell. whom Gen. :\nChiang personally had antagonised\nand who was much courted by the\nCommunist leaders Mao Tse-tung\nand Chou En-lai.\nMarshall Blamed Chiang\nThe Marshall mission to China\nended In utter failure, the first\nmajor setback he has had in his\nlong .and distinguished career. It\nis human to resent a spectacular\nfailure, particularly when life has\nbeen a series of successes. Gen.\nMarshall blamed the Nanking gov\nernment rather than Chinese condi\ntions, of which he knew so little.\nHe contended that a truce be\ntween the legitimate government\nand the Communists was not pos\nsible unless the Communists were\nbrought to power. He believed, with *\nthe young men of the Par Eastern\nDivision of the State Department,\nthat the \"agrarians in Yenan\u201d actu\nally were reformers, In no way con\ntrolled by Moscow.\nThus, when Gen. Marshall became\nSecretary of State In January, 1947,\nhe became determined to use all his\npower to prevent any assistance to\nthe Nanking government. Already\nin September, 1946, he had Issued\nInstructions to suspend shipment to\nChina of certain war materials\nwhich Gen. Chiang had a right to\nreceive under previous formal agree\nments with the United States Gov\nernment.\nRoosevelt Ideas Out\nAs Secretary of State Gen. Mar\nshall considered obsolete formal\nobligations made by President\nRoosevelt to provide the Chlneae\nNationalist Army with the means\nof maintaining itself against the\nCommunists. His animosity to\nward the Nanking regime finally\nwas challenged in December last\nyear when President Truman called\na special session of Congress to vote\ntemporary aid to the Western Euro\npean powers, which had agreed lo\naccept the Marshall Plan. Over the\nop>en opposition of the State De\npartment a token sum was voted\nfor China. In spite of resistance\nby the Secretary of State Congress\nauthorized over jow.uuu.uuu un\neconomic and military assistance\nto China under the ERP.\nGen. Marshall's confidential let\nter to Congress last week, together\nwith the formal objections to any\nfurther expenditure for China\nwhich followed Mr. Royall\u2019s state\nment that China Inevitably will go\nCommunist, was expected to be\nthe kiss of death for the Chinese\ngovernment, which tjie American\ngovernment whole-heartedly sup\nported during the war.\nA number of members of Con\ngress who read Gen. Marshall\u2019s let\nter and heard the testimony of the\nadministration\u2019s spokesman con\ncluded that \u201conce more we are sell\ning a friend and ally down the\nriver.\u201d This time, however, not for\nthe sake of expediency, as was the\ncase with Poland and Yugoslavia,\nbut \"to satisfy the pique of the\ndeeply offended Secretary of State.\u201d\nMembers of the Appropriations\nCommittees of both houses are\naware that even if the whole\namount originally earmarked for\nChina were restored, the State De\npartment has ways and means of\nsabotaging any congressional en\nactment it does not favor.

It would check\nthe report that in 1948 manufacturers did not\nfind investment uses for all the profits they re\ntained after taxes. It should ascertain whether\nplans for expansion are based on the expectation\nof full employment year after year or are based\non the belief that economic depression will soon\nagain throw millions of people out of work.\nThe President\u2019s proposal rejects the idea that\ndepressions are inevitable. lie along with the\nmajority of the American profile believes that\ndepressions are man-made and that we have 1 lie\ndemocratic right to expect our government to\nact to avoid depressions with their mass unem\nployment and their tragic human and economic\nwaste. Maintaining full employment, declared as\nnational policy in the Employment Act of 1946,\nis vital to the achievement of economic democracy\nand to the preservation of our political democ\nracy.\nPEOPLE MEAN NOTHING\nBut it is becoming daily none clear that there\nare people in positions of great economic power\nwho neither believe in nor desire full employment\nat the increasingly higher standard of living made\npossible by improved technology. They show no\nconcern ever the present increase in the ranks of\nthe unemployed. They draw comfort from the\nso-called \u201cbalance\" between supply and demand,\nft means nothing to them that by throwing people\ncut of work ami drying up purchasing power we\nare getting into balance by bringing demand down\nto supply instead of building supply up to de\nmand. This is the short road back to booms and\nbusts Any one who invites us to travel that road\nis leading ns to disaster. The private iron curtain\ncf monopoly that keeps these basic economic\nfacts from the people is as great a threat to our\nfreedom as those forces that threaten us from\nbehind the iron curtain of the Cominform.\nThe question which the President has raised is\nmuch too important to be disposed of by scream\ning \u201cSocialism.*\u2019 If steel and other basic indus\ntries arc not expanding capacity by enough to\nmake full employment possible year after year,\nthe people need to know that and the people need\nIn know w hat the government is going to do\nabout it.\nSincerely yours.\nWALTER P.

They are more attentive to\nwhat goes on outside, less isolated\nin the ivory tower of merely aca\ndemic at times, Byzanlinely aca\ndemic problems and studies.\nTo be sure, it would be deplor\nable if the universities ceased en\ntirely to be Marys in order to be\ncome Marthas. But somewhere be\ntween the two extremes they seem\nto be finding a middle ground\nm , -\nWh\nmils \u2019 'W\u2019x >\u25a0 \u25a0 JB\nUniversity of Salamanca, Spain, welcomed author.

This I\nnoticed even !n circles once so clos\ned to the w'orld that their mem\nbers seemed to be living under\nglass. In Edinburgh, presiding at a\nluneheyn held in my honor, the\nVice-Cnaneellor of the University,\nthe famous English physicist Sir\nEdward Appleton, told me he\ncould see no essential difference\nbetween sot-ailed \u201cpure\u201d science\nand so-called \u2018'applied\u201d science.\nI visited several British univer\nsities. Some were old friends,\nothers I only now had a chance to\nget acquainted with after having\nlong wanted to. For knowing one\nBritish university is a far cry from\nknowing them all: if they are si\nmilar in some respects, in others\neach has its own method of fulfill\ning its mission. Which is very much\nin keeping with the British charact\ner. ethos, and tradition and the\nBritish way of combining a pro\npensity for unity with a taste for\nthe expression of differences. The\nUniversity of London is perhaps\nmore like a Continental university\nthan like Oxford or like Cambridge,\nwhich so much resembles the old\nScottish St. Andrews. In turn, the\nuniversities of Edinburgh and\nGlasgow seem, like London, to re\nsemble universities of the type of\nPAG. 10\nParis and Berlin. Yet all ot them\nare essentially very British.\nThe English seemed much con\ncerned with the problems suggest\ned by the world automation\nwhich ought, I believe to be auto\nmatization. If machines continue\nto take the place not merely of\nmen but of intelligent men, what\nwill become of the majority of the\npopulation in countries like Eng\nland? They will have to stand by\nwith their arms folded, watching\nthe machines perform feats of in\ntelligence and learning that would\nput Pico della Mirandola in the\nshade.

I saw Englishmen reduced\nby the prospect to a state com\nparable to Hamlet\u2019s \u2014a \u201cto be\nor not to be\u201d of a new kind and\nnew dimensions. But not all seem\ned thus disoriented by automation.\nSir Edward Appleton, for example,\ncontemplates the problem with\ntranquil optimism. I was also to\nfind this optimism among the\nGermans, though Germany has its\nshare of uneasy Hamlets perplexed\nby- the problems that the super\ntechnical development of civiliza\ntion is raising. It is necessary un\neasiness. Excessive optimism has\nnever been, by itself, a good coun-\n.

The restless and* dissatisfied\nar\u00ab needed too if problems are to\nbe confronted in their full com\nplexity\nOne tendency seemed to me\ndominant in Europe today; a re\npudiation of the old simplification\nof human problems into someth\ning solvable by the con\nventional \u201cisms.\u201d Not only liberal\nism but socialism itself, in all its\nforms from the English to the Rus\nsian, seeks new solutions. There is\nthe consciousness of a need for\nthem, the certainty that socialism\nCommunist socialism like that\nof Russia, Labor socialism like that\nparty achieved in Britain, democ\ni ratio socialism like that practiced\n\u25a0 in the Scandinavian countries\n! represents less a triumph than a\nfailure. Not, of course, a total fail\nure. like those solutions called Fas\ncist and Nazi, but a sufficiently\nserious one to give political and\nindustrial leaders the right and\nthe responsibility to search, togeth\ner with sociologists, psychologists,\neconomists, religious leaders, and\nfarm leaders, for new approaches\nto the problems of human society\nin an increasingly automatized ci\nvilization.\nI heard more than one Europ\nean social scientist voice the wish\nthat European governments would\nimitate the United- States by re\ngarding the collaboration of these\nspecialists as important. But in fact\nit is already apparent, sometimes\nstrikingly, in modern European ci\nty planning and in the rebuilding\nof bombed areas in Germany, Brit\nain. and the Netherlands. For ex\nample. there are new German\napartment buildings with one\nroom-and-kitchenette apartments\nset aside for widows, numerous in\ncountries devastated by the war\na measure that forestalls quarrels,\ncaused by the presence of two wo\nmen in a single kitchen, in the\nhouseholds where they would\notherwise live. In the same way,\nan attempt is made to provide a\ncertain independence for old peo\nple sharing the homes of children,\ngrandchildren, nieces, or nephews.\nAnother thing: special care is tak\nen perhaps superior to that or\ndinarily taken in U. S., and cer\ntainly in Brazilian, city planning\nin the placing of tall buildings,\nwhich are required to be widely\nseparated. Which shows that the\narchitect does not receive absolute\nfreedom: he is bound by the urban\nor regional plan, part of a whole.\nAnd more and more this whole is\nthe work not only of engineers or\ntown planners but also of sociolog\nists and psychologists, in order that\nthe new or rebuilt cities should\nHEMISPHERE\nconform to the deepest needs of\nthe men, women, and children\nwho will live in them.\n- \u2022 .\ns>; \u25a0 MHanBUMMW . $M\n{UHL SflpH\u00dffc\niMHUIMMa.

Clark and Richard Stanton Rimanoczy)\nA recent dispatch from London states the the church\nhas appealed to the government to do something to stop\nthe enormous increase in gambling.\nFor some time now the British people have been on a\nrecord-busting spree of betting on the ponies, the dogs,\nand the football matches.\nThe Church of England\u2019s committee orf gambling re\nported that, in 1948, betting on these three forms of\ngambling alone amounted to more than $21/L> billion.\nThere is no way of knowing how much more the total\ngambling amounts to because the other forms are un\nder-cover and private affairs.\nBut $2 V'i billion is about 7.6', < of the entire income of\nthe British people, and if we were to add about 2l/>r<\nfor \u201csecret gambling, we would get a total of 10', of\nthe entire income.\nThis amounts to about 33.3 billion, just about the\nsame amount as was spent for clothing.\nThe food bill was the only item that was larger.\nNow the British have never been any more fond of\ngambling than any other normal nation of people.\nIn fact, they have been considered on the conserva\ntive side. But something has happened to make the Brit\nish peaple the world\u2019s champion gamblers.\nThat something is very easy to explain: The socialist\nwelfare state under which Britain lives has given the\npeople what they were promised\u2014more pay for less\nwork. The catch, however, is that there is nothing to\nbuy with the extra money.\nThe people cannot use the money to rent a better\nborne, because there are no homes to rent.\nThey cannot use it to buy more or better clothing be\ncause their ration coupons do not permit it.\nThey cannot use it to buy more and better food be\ncause there is no more for sale.\nThey can spend only so much on movies, trips, etc.,\nbecause there are only so many seats in the theaters and\non the trains.\nThere is no desire in any socialist country to save\nmoney or invest it in a new business, and this is natur\nally true of England today.\nSo with $2 Vi or $3 billion rattling around in their\njeans, what is more natural for the British people to do\nthan to play the ponies, the dog-tracks, the football (soc\ncer) pools, or drop in the back room for a game of cards?\nAt least the people can get a little thrill out of using\ntheir money this way, which is more than can be said\nfor most of the uses they can put it to under the austere\nwelfare state. It\u2019s a great tribute to British people they\ndo as much work under these conditions as they do.\nThere is not much reason for earning money that\ncan\u2019t be spent. k\nYet the British workman has shown great devotion\nto his country and to the cause for which he voted\u2014\nnamely, socialism. Socialism is not failing in Britain be\ncause of the British workers.\nSocialism is failing because it is socialism: a system\nthat stifles human progress and makes like a dreary\nsuccession of dull tasks.\nsuccession of dull tasks. This determination to see a\nthing through is not limited to Great Britain,\nwork by the people of New Zealand and Australia. Pa\ntiently and faithfully the people of these parts of the\nBritish Empire worked with the Socialist Governments\nto make their dreams come true.\nBut there is a limit to the patience of any people, and\nthe people of both New Zealand and Australia decided\nthat socialism had had its chance and failed.\nSo these two countries now have \u201cprivate enterprise\u2019\u2019\ngovernments which must start the difficult job of pick\nling up the pieces of individual liberty and fitting them\ntogether into the framework of a competitive economy.\nI Sermon On The Mount\n-\u2014--- ---- - ---- M.\n\"AND WHEN THOU PRAYEST. thou shall not be as the hypo\ncrites are ...\" Illustration: Dore's \"Publican and Pharisee.\"\nHELP FINANCE THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE i\nI I\nThe Chamber of Commerce is financed mainly by\nthe business men of the community but needs the sup-1\nport of the whole town to carry on its extensive pro\ngram, Many of the people in the community are not\n; aware of the time and money that is spent annually by\n! the organization to foster and develop the activities re\nj sponsible for the growth and welfare of the place in |\n| which we live.\nThe Chamber is giving everyone a chance to assist\nthis year and have a good time while doing it by spon\nsoring a real old time barn dance.

The overwhelming maj\nority of these publishers is against present trends in government\nana politics, and it may be suspected that, of the small minority\nfavering the \u201cwelfare program\u201d will be found a number of publish\ners holding jobs such as postmasters.\nOf those queried. 78 percent said the United States is headed\ninto Socialism. Most of the editors believe this will be brought about\nby the Socialistic laws we already have or those that are proposed.\nWhile almost all of the \u201cwelfare\u201d laws we have, or which are pro\nposed, are pure socialism, we believe the real Socialism will come\nwhen the national economy blows up in our faces. I\nWhen all this bubble \u2018busts \u2019, then is when you wiu see tne\nmil-ions of employees out of work demanding that a bankrupt gov\nernment take over industry and operate it with some new kind of\nfinancing. That is when we will get the real thing in Socialism.\nAlmost all of the miners right now are in favor of the govern\nment ownership and operation of the mines. John L. Lewis is not,\nbecause his fat salary would come to an end. The same thing is true\nof the railway unions.\nWe don\u2019t think that President Truman believes that he is a\nSocialist any more than Senator Taft thinks he is, but both of them\nhave done a good job of furthering the Socialistic program. In fact\nalmost all of the senators and congressmen have supported Socialism\nmore or less.\nCommunism is a milder form of Socialism. Russia is not a com\nmunistic state. It is a Socialist state, with the inevitable tyranny\nthat must go with Socialism, plus the brutality and despotism of all\ntne Czars. And something like that is what we fear we are going\nto ^et in the United States when the inflation collapses.\nOf the publishers replying to The American Press questionnaire,\n89 percent were either against changing the Taft-Hartley .law or in\nfavor of making it more stringent, 66 percent were in favor of re\ntaining the present cigarette and liquor taxes or increasing the same,\n62 percent favored the repeal of the luxury taxes, 85 perecen favored\nsimplification of the income tax laws, 49 percent favored the ex\npansion of social security to more people and 46 percent opposed\ntbui 59 percent opposed any increase in benefits while 36 percent\nfavored increase), and 71 percent favored the return of many present\nfederal activities to the states,\nv.

SAMl'EL B. PETTENGILL\nFormer Congressman from Indiana 'Dem.. 1910-38)\nSocialism's ,s e c r e t weapon is\nmoney. Governments formerly\ntrained power by the sword and\nswelled their coffers by conquest\nand tribute. That method is still\nused, but. chiefly against foreigners\nModern governments obtain power\nover their own people in a more\nsubtle fashion. They tax away the\nearnings of their people, an/1 then\ndole some of it back to them in\nsubsidies, gifts, grants-in-aid, and\nthe avvanfT of huge government con\ntracts. By this process they become\n, the masters of men. and cease to be\ntheir servants. The historic relation\nship is reversed. Instead of go'veni\nment coining to the people for its\nsupport, the people come to the\ngovernment for their support Hitler\nput all groups in Germany in pawn\nto hiri via the, money route. In the\nface of the granting or withholding\nof public money, opposition died\nawrw. People began to keep their\nmouths shut\u2014business men first\nhut. finally, editors, educators and\nministers. He thus united both con\nservatives and radicals behind him.\nThis is a very important point.\nIn Ih'.s country, governors of\nstates, mayors of cities and mem\nbers of business organizations\u2014\nChambers of Commerce\u2014 including\nthose most opposed to Socialism in\nthe ' abstract, become beggars at\nWashington foii a return of some\nof the money collected from them\nin their own communities\u2014jess the\npolitical brokerage. A s beggars,\nthey fawn and smirk. Big govern\nment breeds little men. The great\n\u201cpower of the purse.\" with which\nthe representatives of the taxpayers\nonce held the executive branch in\ncheck, is lapidly passim) into the\nhands of a political Santa Claus.\nNot one of the extensions of Soc\nialism could be put into effect with\nout money. Cut off the money sup\nply- and the power to borrow\u2014and\nyou stop them in their tracks. As\nJefferson said. \u201cWe must make our\nselection between economy and lib\nerty. or profusion and servitude.\"\nTax and Spend\nHarry Hopkins gave the formula\nfor Socialism\u2014tax. spend and elect.\nVet because they fail to grasp the\ngrand strategy of freedom, various\ngroups exhaust themselves on scat\ntered tactical skirmishes\u2014good in\nthemselves, but futile in the fac > of\nthis overpowering flood of money.\nJustice Holmes used to say. \u201cWe\nmust strike for the jugular and let\nthe rest go.\" I would urge no one to\nabandpu the fight for his own group,\nbut t!ie number one plank in all\nplatforms must be the exact reverse\nof the Hopkins formula-\u201cReduce\ntaxes and spending, especially at\nthe federal level. Keep government\npoor and remain free.\u201d\nMake that the number one plank\nin all platforms for freedom. The\ndoctors can then fight socialized\nmedicine; owners cf real estate can\nfight public housing; others can\ntight federal control of education:\nbusiness can fight government com\npetition: others can fight to relieve\nprivately created wealth of some of\nthe tax burden. With reduced Fed\neral spending and sharply reduced\ntaxes as the number one plank of\nall groups, they can then fight with\nsome chance of success. As it is.\nwith each group fighting some\nsingle phase of Socialism in which\nthe others arc not particularly in\nterested. they are picked off like\n.sitting ducks.\nThe Socialist planners lull the un\nthinking with the trick question.\n\u201cWhat freedom have you lost?\"\nThat\u2019s easy lo answer. It is my\nf redem to keep what I earn and\nSperH it as I please. That's the\nvital distinction between European\nSocialism and American individua\nlism. \"To have and to hold.\" written\ninto milliops of title deeds, tells the\nstory of the individual incentives\nand rewards that have produced\nAmerica's magnificent achievement.'\nA g\u2019 and strategy for freedom is I\nimperative. We must unite on one\npoint, easily understood, which\ntouches the pocketbook nerve of\nmilliors of voters. Intellectual argu\nments are not enough. You' must\nappeal to the self-interest of mil\nlions. We must find the common de\nnominator of mass resistance to\nSocialism The common denomina\nte! is the pocketbook. On that con-1\ncept and that alone can we mobi\nlize an army sufficient in numbers\nto wage successful war.\nWe must show millions of voters\nhow they are being hurt\u2014how their\nsecurity for old age is melting\naway.\nDollars Lose Sense\nThere are 78,000.000 life insurance\npolicy-holders. As money becomes\ncheap, their security vanishes. A\n$10,000 policy paid up in 1940 has\nlost $4,800 or more in terms of\nwhat, it will buy today.\nA life insurance president has just j\ntold us of the disastrous effect of\nthe cheap money policies of the past\n20 years on life insurance security.!\nThe insurance companies are forced j\nto earn less on their investments.\nTherefore, they must charge higher\npremiums for the same protection.\nTljen when the policy is paid, the\nmoney received is taxed more, and i\nbuys less. To cover all these losses.;\na typical life insurance holder needs\nto take out 90 per cent more insur- j\nance to provide the same purchas\ning power and protection as in 1929.\nMojI of the beneficiaries of lifej\ninsurance are women. Tell them\nwhat, taxes and debt and rotting\nmoney are doing to the security\ntheir husbands have worked so hard\nto provide. \"Old age and w-ant\u2014thou\nill matched pair \"\nThen there are other millions who\nown government bonds. A bond\nbought ten years ago for $75 can be\ncashed today for $190. But the $100\u2019\nwill buy you less /than the $60 did1\nwhen you turned it over to the gov\nernment. And you are ten years!\nolder.\nThen you have 50 to 60 million\npeople who have been compelled to\nbuy what are called \"social se\ncurity\" cards Their hoped-for se\ncurity melts away as dollars be\ncome cheap. To make up the loss,\nbills are in Congress to pay theni\nmore of these rotting dollars, add\ning to the tax burden to be carried\nby ali industry, forcing prices still\nhigher, and the music goes round;\nand round.\nThe guarantees of government:\nare writ on water and carved in\nsand. Something for nothing is the\nmoral cancer of a free society. Once\nbegun, there is no stopping its dead\nly course except to .find the lowest\ncommon denominator of the mass\nresistance of millions of voters\u2014\nthe pocket book and the fear of pov\nerty in old age.

To world\ngovernments trying to under\nstand Russia\u2019s attitude on war\nas an instrument of policy a\nsection of the report called\n\"Peaceful Coexistence and the\nStruggle for World Peace\u201d was\nthe subject of closest scrutiny.\nThis is the text of that section.\nThe Communist Party of the\nSoviet Union considers that the\nchief aim of its foreign-policy\nactivity is to provide peaceful\nconditions for the building of .a\nCommunist society in the U.S.SR.\nand developing the world Socialist\nsystem and together with the other\npeace-loving peoples to deliver\nmankind from a world war of\nextermination.\nThe C. P. S. U. maintains that\nforces capable of preserving and\npromoting world peace have arisen\nand are growing in the world. It\nis becoming possible to establish\nessentially new relations between\nstates.\nImperialism knows no relations\nbetween states other than those of\ndomination and subordination, of\noppression of the weak by the\nstrong. It bases international rela\ntions on dictates and intimidation,\non violence and arbitrary\nregards wars of aggression as a\nnatural means of settling inter\nnational issues. For the Imperialist\ncountries, diplomacy has been, and\nremains, a tool for imposing their\nwill upon other nations and pre\nparing wars. At the time of the\nundivided rule of imperialism the\nissue of war and peace was settled\nby the finance and industrial\noligarchy in the utmost secrecy\nfrom the peoples.\nInternational Relations\nSocialism, In contrast to im\nperialism, advances a new type\nof international relations. The\nforeign policy of the Socialist\ncountries, whidh is based on the\nprinciple of peace, the equality\nand self-determination of nations,\nand respect for the independence\nand sovereignty of all countries, as\nwell as the fair, humane methods\nof Socialist 'diplomacy, are exert\ning a growing influence on the\nworld situation. At a time when\nimperialism no longer plays a\ndominent role in international re\nlations while the Socialist system\nis playing an increasing role, and\nwhen the influence of the coun\ntries that have won national in\ndependence and of the masses\njof the people In the capitalist\ncountries \"has grown very consid\nerably, it is becoming possible for\nthe new principles advanced by\nsocialism to gain the upper hand\nover the principles of aggressive\nimperialist policy.\nFor the first time In history,\na situation has arisen in which\nnot only the big states, but also\nthe small ones, the countries\nwhich have chosen independent\ndevelopment, and all the states\n\u2022 which want peace, are in a posi\ntion, irrespective of their strength,\nto pursue an independent foreign\npolicy.\nThe issue of war aAd peace\nis the principal issue of today.\nImperialism is the only source\nof the war danger. The imperialist\ncamp is making preparations for\nthe worst crime against mankind\n\u2014a world thermonuclear war that\ncan bring unprecedented destruc\ntion to entire countries and wipe\nout entire nations. The problem\nof war and peace has become a\n, life-and-death problem for hun\ndreds of millions of people.\nThe peoples must concentrate\n, their efforts on curbing the im\nperialists in good time and pre\nventing them from making use\nof lethal weapons. The impor\ntant thing is to ward off a thermo\nnuclear war, not to let it break\nout. This can be done by the\npresent generation.\nWorld Socialist System\nThe consolidation of the Soviet\nstate and the formation of the\nworld Socialist system were his\ntoric steps towards the realisation\nof mankind\u2019s age-old dream of\nbanishing wars from the life of\nsociety. In the Socialist part of the\nworld there are no classes or social\ngroups interested in starting a war.\nSocialism, outstripping capitalism\nin a number of important branches\nof science and technology, has\nsupplied the peace-loving peoples\nwith powerful material means of\ncurbing imperialist aggression.\nCapitalism established its rule\nwith fire and sword, but socialism\ndoes not require war to spread its\nideals. Its weapon is its superiority\nover the old system in social or\nganisation, political system, econ\nomy, the improvement of the\nstandard of living and spiritual\nculture.\nThe Socialist system is a natural\ncenter of attraction for the peace\nloving forces of the globe. The\nprinciples of its foreign policy are\ngaining ever greater international\nrecognition and support. A vast\npeace zone has taken shape on\nearth. In addition to the Socialist\ncountries, it includes a large group\nof non-Socialist countries that for\nvarious reasons are not interested\nin starting a war. The emergence\nof those countries in the arena of\nworld politics has substantially al\ntered the balance of forces in favor\nof peace.\nThere is a growing number of\ncountries that adhere to a policy of\nneutrality and strive to safeguard\nthemselves against the hazards of\nparticipation in military blocs.\nOn Averting War\nIn the new historical epoch the\nmasses have a far greater opportu\nnity of actively influencing the\nsettlement of International issues.\nThe peoples are taking the solu\ntion of the problem of war and\npeace into their own hands more\nand more vigorously. The anti-war\nmovement of the masses, which\ntakes various forms, is a major\nfactor in the struggle for peace.\nThe international working class,\nthe most uncompromising and\nmost consistent fighter against im\nperialist war, is the great organiz-\nTHE SUNDAY STAR\nWaihinftm, D.

The growing su\nperiority of the Socialist forces\nover the forces of imperallsm,\nof the forces of peace over those\nof war, will make it actually possi\nble to banish world war from the\nlife of society even before the\ncomplete victory of socialism on\nearth, with capitalism surviving\nin a part of the world. The victory\nof soolalism throughout the world\nwill do away completely with the\nsocial and national causes of all\nwars. To abolish war and establish\neverlasting peace on earth is a\nhistorical mission of communism.\nGeneral and complete disarma\nment under strict international\ncontrol is a radical way of guar\nanteeing a durable peace. Imper\nialism has imposed an unprece\ndented burden of armaments on\nthe people. Socialism sees its duty\ntowards mankind in delivering it\nfrom this absurd waste of national\nwealth. The solution of this prob\nlem would have historical signifi\ncance for mankind. By an active\nand determined effort the peoples\ncan and must force the imperial\nists into disarmament.\nPeace Is a Necessity\nSocialism has offered mankind\nthe only reasonable principle of\nmaintaining relations between\nstates at a time when the world\nis divided into two systems the\nprinciple of the peaceful coexist\nence of states with different social\nsystems, put forward by Lenin.\nPeaceful coexistence of the So-\nContinued From Pare B-l\nprogram called for \"the dictator\nship of the proletariat,\" and the\nestablishment of the \"socialist or\nder.\u201d There also were rather bour\ngeois requests for such things as\nan eight-hour working day and a\n\"democratic republic.\u201d\nReds Emerge\nBy the Eighth Party Congress in\n1919, however, the Bolshevik wing\nhad become the Communist Party,\nand the \u201cdictatorship of the pro\nletariat\u201d had become a reality in\nRussia.\nIt was time, the Soviet leaders\nfelt, for a new party program.\nThe new plan charted the steps\nto be taken to establish the \u201cso\ncialist state.\u201d\n(Marx had said that a state pro\ngresses from capitalism, to so\ncialism, and then, finally, to com\nmunism.)\nBecause the new Soviet Repub\nlic was ravaged by civil war and\nforeign intervention, the program\ngave priority to a strong standing\narmy.\nLenin told the Congress that\n\"the existence of the Soviet Re\npublic side by side with imperialist\nstates tor a protracted period of\ntime is unthinkable. In the end,\none or the other will be victorious.\nUntil that end is at hand, a series\ncf the most frightful clashes be\ntween the Soviet Republic and the\nbourgeois stales is inevitable.\u201d\nThe program promised the peo\nple a series of material improve\nments. Women were promised lib\neration \u201cfrom the material bur\ndens of obsolete domestic house\nkeeping by replacing it with com\nmunal houses common dining\nrooms, central laundries, nurseries\nand the like.\u2019\nFree Education\nEducation was to be free and*\ncompulsory up to the age of 17,\nhousing would be improved and a\nsix-hour working day established.\nIn 1936, Stahn decreed that \u201cso\ncialism\u201d had been established in\nthe Soviet Un ! on. In Communist\njargon, under socialism, people live\n\"from each according to his\nability, and to each according to\nhis work.\u201d Under \"communism,\u201d\npeople live \"from each according\nto his ability, and to each accord\ning to his needs.\u201d\nThe party program necessary to\nset a course toward ultimate com\nmunism was promised in 1939 and\nagain in 1952, but not until last\nweek was the utopian blueprint\nrevealed.\nThe ipost radical departure\ncialist and capitalist countries is\nan objective necessity for the de\nvelopment of human society. War\ncannot and must not serve as a\nmeans of settling international\ndisputes. Peaceful coexistence or\ndisastrous war\u2014such is the alter\nnative offered by history. Should\nthe Imperialist aggressors never\ntheless venture to start a new\nworld war, the peoples will no\nlonger tolerate a system which\ndrags them into devastating wars.\nThey will sweep imperialism away\nand bury it.\nPeaceful coexistence implies re\nnunciation of war as a means of\nsettling international disputes,\nand their solution by negotiation,\nequality, mutual understanding\nand trust between countries; con.\nsideratlon of mutual interests;\nnon-interference in internal af\nfairs; recognition of the right of\nevery people to solve all the prob\nlems of their country by them\nselves; strict respect for the sov\nereignty and territorial integrity\nof all countries; promotion of eco\nnomic and cultural co-operation\non the basis of complete equality\nand mutual benefit.\nPeaceful coexistence serves as\na basis for the peaceful compe\ntition between socialism and capi\ntalism on an international scale\nand constitutes a specific form of\nclass struggle between them. As\nthey consistently pursue the policy\nof peaceful coexistence, the So\ncialist countries are steadily\nstrengthening the positions of the\nworld Socialist system in its com\npetition with capitalism. Peaceful\ncoexistence affords more favorable\nopportunities for the struggle of\nthe working class in the capitalist\ncountries and facilitates the\nstruggle of the peoples of the\ncolonial and dependent countries\nfor their liberation.\nfrom the 1919 program was the\nKhrtishchev-inspired - view that\nwar is not necessary for the\nspread of communism.\n\"Capitalism established its rule\nwith fire and sword,\u201d the program\nstated, \"but socialism does not re\nquire war to spread its ideals. Its\nweapon is its superiority over the\nold system in social organization,\npolitical system, economy, the im\nprovement of the standard of liv\ning and spiritual culture.\u201d\nU. S.

The\npolicy of peaceful coexistence is in\naccord with the vital Interests of\nall mankind, except the big monop\noly magnates and the militarists.\nPeaceful Co-existence\nThe Soviet Union has consist\nently pursued, and will continue to\npursue, the policy of peaceful co\nexistence of states with different\nsocial systems.\nThe Communist Party of the\nSoviet Union advances the follow\ning tasks in the field of inter\nnational relations:\nTo use, together with the other\nSocialist countries, peaceful states\nand peoples every means of pre\nventing war and providing condi\ntions for the complete elimination\nof war from the life of society;\nTo pursue a policy of establish\ning sound international relations,\nand work for the disbandment of\nall military blocs opposing each\nother, the discontinuance of the\n\"cold war\u2019\u2019 and the propaganda\nof enmity and hatred among the\nnations, and the abolition of all\nair, naval, rocket and other mili\ntary bases on foreign territory.\nWork on Disarmament\nTo work for general and com\nplete disarmament under strict\ninternational control;\nTo strengthen relations of\nfraternal friendship and close\nco-operation with the countries\nof Asia, Africa and Latin Amer\nica which are fighting to attain\nor consolidate national inde\npendency with all peoples and\nThe Foreign Scene\nviet attacks on the capitalist way\nof life.,\nIndeed, the material promises\noffered the Soviet people were so\nsimilar to those made in 1919.\nthat it seemed by 1981 the Soviet\ncitizens finally would begin to re\nceive what was first promised\nthem 42 years ago.\nMany of the goals, in fact, such\nas free medical care, free educa\ntion and free noon meals, already\nare accepted as away of life in\nmany bourgeois countries.\nAmerican officials found noth\ning new in the program, but\ncarefully noted Soviet determina\ntion to win over the newly inde\npendent countries of the world.\nThe officials also found that\nPremier Khrushchev\u2019s influence\nin party circles is still high. This\nadditional for planes, ships and\nmissiles for military build-up.\n36. Completed action on a gen\neral farm bill.\nCivil Defense:\nNew Interest\nA House Military Operations\nsubcommittee last week held\nhearings on an administration\nrequest for a 9207 million civil\ndefense appropriation.\nThe Pentagon has long pon\ndered this question:\nIf people are interested most in\nwhat affects them most directly\n(and they are) why has there been\nsuch apathy about civil defense?\nNumerous reasons have been\ngiven in the numerous years when\nCongress has been cutting to the\nbone the modest requests for\nmoney for civil defense.\nIn the last 10 years the country\nhas spent only $619 million\u2014or\nan estimated 34 cents per year\nper person\u2014on civil defense. A\ncivil defense budget submitted by\nthe White House earlier this year\ntotalled $lO4 million. Then in his\ndefense spending budget the\nPresident requested $207 million\nmore, to bring the total for one\nyear to half the amount spent\nin the last 10 years.\nThe problem has not been en\ntirely fiscal, it\u2019s true.

All the organiza\ntions and parties that strive to\navert war, the neutralist and pact\nfist movements and the bourgeois\ncircles that advocate peace and\nnormal relations between countries\nwill meet with understanding and\nsupport on the part of the Soviet\nUnion; 1\nTo pursue a policy of develop\ning international co-operation in\nthe fields of trade, cultural rela\ntions, science and technology;\nTo be highly vigilant with regard\nto the aggressive circles, which are\nintent on violating peace; to ex\npose, in good time, the initiators\nof military adventures: to take\nall necessary steps to safeguard\nthe security and inviolability of\nof our Socialist country and the\nSocialist camp as a whole.\nTo Oppose All Wars'\nThe C.

This would mean\nfinding, marking and stocking\nshelters in existing Government\nand private office buildings, fac\ntories, schools and churches.\nThere is no provision for building\nnew shelters; such a construction\nprogram would run into many\ntimes $207 million. No shelters are\nprovided for individual homes or\napartments. As explained, the ad\nministration program would take\ncare of space for 50 million Amer\nicans principally in large cities.\nIt was estimated that 10 to 15\nmillion lives could be saved in\ncase of a thermo-nuclear attack.\nUnder the chairmanship of Rep\nresentative Holifield, Democrat of\nstruggle of the oppressed peoples\nand their just anti-imperialist\nwars of liberation.\nThe Communist party of the\nSoviet Union will hold high the\nbanner of peace and friendship\namong the nations.\nIn another section titled \"The\nInter national Revolutionary\nMovement of the Working\nClass\u201d there were also com\nments on war and peace. An\nexcerpt from this section fol\nlows:\nCommunists have never held\nthat the road to revolution lies\nnecessarily through wars between\ncountries. Socialist revolution is\nnot necessarily connected with\nwar. Although both world wart,\nwhich were started by the im\nperialists, culminated in Socialist\nrevolutions, revolutions are quite\nfeasible without war. The great\nobjectives of the working class can\nbe realized without world war. To\nday the conditions for this are\nmore favorable than ever.\nThe working class and its van\nguard\u2014the Marxlst-Lenlnist par\nties\u2014prefer to achieve the trans\nfer of power from the bourgeoisie\nto the proletariat by peaceful\nmeans, without civil war. Realiza\ntion of this possibility would meet\nthe interests of the working class\nand the people as a whole, it would\naccord with the national interests\nof the country.\nThe working class, supported by\nthe majority of the people and\nfirmly repelling opportunist ele\nments incapable of renouncing the\npolicy of compromise with the\ncapitalists and landlords, can de\nfeat the reactionary, anti-popular\nforces, win a solid majority in par\nliament, transform it from a tool\nserving the class interests of the\nbourgeoisie into an instrument\nserving the working people, launch\na broad mass struggle outside par\nliament, smash the resistance of\nthe reactionary forces and provide\nthe necessary conditions for a\npeaceful socialist revolution. This\ncan be done only by extending and\ncontinuously developing the class\nstruggle of the workers and peas\nants and the middle strata of the\nurban population against big\nmonopoly capital and reaction, for\nfar-reaching social reforms, for\npeace and socialism.\n'Nonpeaceful Transition'\nWhere the exploiting classes\nresort to violence against the\npeople, the possibility of a non\npeaceful transition to socialism\nshould be borne in mind. Len\ninism maintains, and historical\nexperience confirms, that the\nruling classes do not yield power\nof their own free will. Hence, the\ndegree of bitterness of the class\nstruggle and the forms it takes\nwill depend not so much on the\nproletariat as on the strength of\nthe reactionary groups\u2019 resistance\nto the will of the overwhelming\nmajority of the people, and on the\nuse of force by these groups at\na particular stage of the strug\ngle for socialism. In each par\nticular country the actual ap\nplicability of one method of\ntransition of socialism or the\nother depends on concrete his\ntorical conditions.\nIt may well be that as the forces\nof socialism grow, the working\nclass movement gains strength\nand the positions of capitalism\nare weakened, there will arise in\ncertain countries a situation in\nwhich it will be preferable for the\nbourgeoisie, as Marx and Lenin\nturn man who is a firm anti\ncommunist.\nThe differences between these\ntwo leaders symbolize, in a sense,\nthe change in the Congo\u2019s political\nclimate since it received its inde\npendence 13 months ago from\nBelgium.\nThe chaos and violence that\nmarked the country\u2019s early days\nleft an indelible mark on the\nCongo\u2019s responsible leaders, and\nthe choosing of Mr. Adoula was\nan acknowledgment that some\nthing besides strong words are\nnecessary. Both responsibility and\nintegrity are needed.\n\"The Congo must not become a\nbattlefield for the cold war,\u201d Mr.\nAdoula said on assuming the\npremiership. \"Authority must be\nreinstated and respected. To that\nCalifornia, a frequent critic of\ncivil defense short-comings, the\nhearings turned out to be the\nliveliest in town last week.\nNight Raids?\nRepresentative Martha W.\nGriffiths, Democrat of Michigan,\nthought it was a little silly to\nassume that the need for shelter\nwould necessarily come during\nworking hours when people would\nbe downtown in offices and public\nbuildings. What would happen if\nit came in the middle of the\nnight? she asked. It was a good\nquestion and she wasn\u2019t satisfied\nwith the only answer that\ndeveloped, which was to the\neffect that people would just have\nto go back downtown.\nSecretary of Defense McNamara,\nunder whom the civil defense has\nnow been placed, appeared and\nspoke of additional expenditures\nplanned by the administration\nwhich would put the total at\nabout S3OO million. He spoke\ncalmly and soberly of the lack of\ntime to evacuate the population\nof a great city in case of missile\nattack (15 minutes only), and\ngave with feeling this estimate\nof what might happen:\n\u201cIn a nuclear attack several\nmillion Americans\u2014perhaps\nseveral tens of millions\u2014might\nbe killed.\u201d\nOn the Senate side, the\nappropriations committee already\nhad approved the $207 million\nand the prospects were that the\nmagnitude of the task was not\nintimidating the legislators into\nan easy despair this time.\nforesaw it, to agree to the means\nof production being purchased\nfrom it and for the proletariat to\n\"pay off\u201d the bourgeoisie. \u2022; j\nThe success of the struggle\nwhich the working class wages\nfor the victory of the revolution '\nwill depend on how well the work\ning class and its party master the '\nuse of all forms of straggler\npeaceful and non-peaceful, parlia-'\nmentary and extra-parliamentary\n\u2014and how well they are prepared\nto replace one form of struggle by\nanother as quickly and unex- r\npectedly as possible.\nThe Transition Stages\nWhile the principal law-gov\nerned processes of the Socialist\nrevolution are common to all\ncountries, the diversity of the na\ntional peculiarities and traditions\nthat have arisen in the course of ,\nhistory creates specific conditions ,\nfor the revolutionary process and\nfor the variety of forms and rates\nof the proletariat\u2019s advent to\npower. This predetermines the\npossibility and necessity, in a' \u201c\nnumber of countries, of transition \u201e\nstages in the struggle for the 1\ndictatorship of the proletariat,- *\nand a variety of forms of political -\norganization of the society build- \u2019\ning socialism. But whatever the \u2018\nform in which the transition \u2018\nfrom capitalism to socialism is\neffected, that transition can come .\nabout only through revolution. \u00a3\nHowever varied the forms of a\nnew, people's state power in the\nperiod of Socialist construction\ntheir essence will be the same \u2014\u25a0\ndictatorship of the proletariat, 4 *\nwhich represents genuine demooc\nracy for the working people.\nA bourgeois republic, however\ndemocratic, however hallowed by\nslogans purporting to express the\nwill of the people or nation as a\nwhole, or an extraclass will, in- \u2019\nevitably remains in practice\u2014ow\ning to the existence of private\ncapitalist ownership of the means\nof production\u2014a dictatorship of\nthe bourgeoisie, a machine for the \u00bb\nexploitation and suppression of ll\nthe vast majority of the working\npeople by a handful of capitalists. <\nIn contrast to the bourgeoisie, -\nwhich conceals the class character\nof the state, the working class\ndoes not deny the class character\nof states.\nDictatorship Explained\nThe dictatorship of the prole \u2022\ntarlat is a dictatorship of the over\nwhelming' majority over the mi- -\nnorlty; it is directed against the\nexploiters, against the oppression.\nof peoples and nations, and is\naimed at abolishing all exploita\ntion of man by man. The dicta-);\ntorshlp of the proletariat express\nes not only the interest of the\nworking class, but also those of '\nall working people; its chief con\ntent is not violence but creation, '\nthe building of a new, classless\nsociety, and the defense of its gains\nagainst the enemies of socialism. '\nOvercoming the split in its ranks\nis an important condition for the V\nworking class to fulfilll its historic\nmission. No bastion of imperialism\ncan withstand a closely knit works ~*\ning class that exercises unity of\naction. The Communist parties\nfavor cooperation with the Social- .\nDemocratic parties not only in\nthe struggle for peace, for better\nliving conditions for the working *\npeople and for the preservation*\nand extension of their democratic\nrights and freedoms, but also in,,\nthe straggle to win power and/\nbuild a Socialist society. \u00a3\nend we must have a government\n(irm, dynamic and united.\u201d\nMr. Adoula will find it quite\ndifficult to put this into practice)\nhowever. If it were not for the\npresence of United Nations troops,\nno one knows what condition the\nCongo would be in now.\nThe U. N. has brought a certain\namount of stability to the Congo,\nbut there can be no effective gov-:\nemment until Katanga Province,\nthe country\u2019s richest and most\nproductive, is brought back under\ngovernment rule.\nAt present, Moise Tshqjnbe has\nrefused to end his \"independent\u201d\nKatanga government, but last\nweek, Mr. Adoula said he would\nuse force if necessary to bring\nKatanga into line.\nQuotation\nof the Week\nMankind has always built a\"\u2022\nlittle more than he has hitherto\nbeen able or willing to destroy;\ngot more children than he has\nbeen able to kill; invented more\nlaws and customs than he had any\nintention of observing ;\u2022 founded\nmore religions than he was able'\nto practice or even to believe in';\nmade in general many more\npromises than he could keep;\nand has been known more than,\nonce to commit suicide through\nmere fear of death.

And how\nthe Republicans were similarly looking\nof the Democratic\nto the well-being\nticket after similar information\nbrought up\nenson ?\nNow\nSocialists have\nthat there was\nold parties,\nlike a string of fresh welnerwursts.\neach looking out for the other's Inter\nwas\nregarding candidate Stev\nthat just illustrates what we\nbeen insisting,\nno difference in the\nthat they hang together\nlong\nests.\nNow it appears that at long last the\npoliticians of both parties have \"tum\nbled\" to the fact that a Socialist econ\nomy is the only method whefeby our\nsystem of exchange can be saved from\nbursting like a bladder balloon that\nhas been stepped on by a cow. There\nfore they are both anxious to crawl\ninto the Socialist bed, but each party is\nreluctant to make the first move, con\nsequently they are adopting the team\nwork of each shoving the other and\ncharging each other with being Social\nists in the hope (and probably correct\nly) that the public will gradually come\nto believe the charges and that by that\ntime they will both have managed to\nease themselves so far under the So\ncialist covers that they will give the\nappearance of having been there all\nthe time.\nSimple, isn't it? But it creates a\nproblem for Socialists.\nMy experience has been that\ni politician of either of the old parties\ntries to get Into the Socialist bed, the\nSocialist, if he knows what is good for\nhim, will Immediately climb out on\nother side.\nNow\nold parties\nto get into the Socialist bed it\nthe only thing left for a self-respecting\nSocialist to do is Jump out of the win\ndow, climb the nearest tree and pull it\nup by the roots.\nBy Kum, politics certainly\nstrange bedfellows.

Everyone in the\ntown and from miles around wbo\nwas able to get there seemed to\nbe milling about on the wide,\nshady lawn. A reporter plied\nGreer with questions about her\nplans for the future. Pictures\nwere snapped of the lovely old\nhouse, the great crowd. Sitting\nalone cm the window-seat of the\nlibrary after it nad been com\npletely dismantled, Greer listened\nto the unintelligible cries tnat\nknocked off the treasures to the\nexultant buyers. She nad no wish\nto go outside and waten the fam\nily heirlooms being sold on the\nblock and carried away. She was\nthankful for a numbness that\nhelped ner not to feel too much.\nWhen sne came out at last, the\nold house was empty, the crowd\nscattered and gone away. The\nmoney realized from the sale\nwould be applied to her father\u2019s\nhuge mountain of debt.

Almost\nmore than looking on the face\nof her dead father, this was like\nsaving a last farewell to a corpse\n\u2014the corpse of ner own vouth. It\nlay quiet and dead, around and\nwithin ner. She felt she would\nnever be young again.\nSlowly sne walked up the\nstairs, througn the bedrooms, and\nthen as if having gazed too long\non a tragedy, came quickly back\ndown the stairs again. She went\ninto the library to get ner nat\nand purse. Better to get it over\nquickly, to go to her Aunt Har\nriet\u2019s at once Nothing could be\nbetter calculated to change her\nmood than the austerely efficient\natmosphere of her Aunt Harriet\u2019s\nthose wbo oppose these measures\nthey are termed \u201csocialistic.\u201d\nSincerely yours,\nBILL LANTAFF.\nSure Jail Sentence\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio tif\u2014After Oct.\n22, any motorist convicted under\nOhio law of drunken driving must\nserve at least three days in jail,\nj Gov.

Oh. couldn\u2019t people\nleave her alone even to this mo\nment of goodbye?\nBut the footsteps came on. In\nexorably, and as she turned back\nto the hallway she stopped short\nin amazement. For she was face\nto face with Rocky A1 verson!\nFor a moment Greer stared at\nRocky as if he had been an in\nhabitant from another world. And\nindeed no one had been further\nfrom her thoughts than this man\nwho stood so calmly before ner\nnow. gazing at her with dark, im\npenetrable eyes. Again that feel\ning of antagonism swept over her,\nthat sense of being disapproved,\ncriticized\u2014and drawing herself\nup she managed in spite of her\nworn grief to look proud and\nlovely and almost untouched.\nRocky Ahrerson was straight\nand strongly built and everything\nabout him from his felt net to\nhto light gray suit bad a perfec\ntion that to Greer seemed annoy\ning precision. What right had be\nto stand there, so beautifully\ngroomed, so sure and easy of\nmanner, when within her all was\ntumult and bewilderment? When\nshe felt grubby and tired and not\nat all like her usual self? But of\ncourse, what really annoyed oer\nwas that he was here at all\u2014in\nthese last few moments of her\nSdbye to her old home.

It declared:\n\u201cThe military center has\nmoved from England to the\nUnited States. America, the\nmightiest capitalist state, has\nbecome the strongest world ex\nploiter.

Within two decades\nthe Communist society will on\nthe whole be built in the U.S.\nS.R.\nThe world capitalist system\non the whole is ripe for the\nsocial revolution of the prole\ntariat.\nTo eliminate wars, to assert\never-lasting peace on earth,\nsuch is the historic mission of\ncomipunism. \u2019 . \u25a0 |\nThe Soviet Union has con\nsistently pursued, and will con-j\ntinue to pursue the policy of\npeaceful coexistence of states\nwith different social systems, ;\nNo Longer Just a Specter\nCommunism, which had once\nseamed A. mere specter, became\nthe greatest force of modem\ntimes, a type of society that is\nbeing built up over vast areas\nof the globe.\nThe party regards the con-;\nstruction qLcommunism in the;\nU.S.S.R. aifthe Soviet peoples\u2019;\ngreat internationalist task, in\nkeeping with the interests of\nthe world socialist system as a\nwhole, and with the interests of\nthe international proletariat\nand of all mankind.\nThere is an adcelerated crea\ntion of the material conditions\nthat make possible the replace-;\nment of capitalist by Commun\nist production relations, that is.\nthe accomplishment of the\nsocial revolution which is the\naim of the Communist Party, '\nI the politically-conscious expon-i\nent of the class movement of\n| the proletariat. | !\nSoviet experience has shown\nthat the peoples are able to\nachieve socialism only as a re\nsult of the socialist revolution 1\nand the implementation of the\ndictatorship of the proletariat. <\nin the Soviet Union, the pro- 1\n\u2022gram said:\n, \u201cWhen the Soviet people en-)\n'Joy all this well-being under\ncommunism, hundreds of mil\ni lions of persons throughout the\nworld will say \u2018we are for com-!\nmunism; not through war. but <\n' because of its\u2019 more perfect i\norganization of society, the\nflourishing of its productive\nsources and the creation of all\n, the conditions for the well-;\nbeing of the people which is\ncapturing the heart and minds\nof everyone.\u2019\u201d ,\nEconomic aid to underde\nveloped countries was declared\n'to be a cornerstone, of the\nparty\u2019s international policy.\nAid to Other Countries\n\u201cThe Communist Party,\u201d the\nprogram saitf, \u201cconsiders it to\nbe its international duty to\nhelp peoples who are taking\npart in the maintenance and\nstrengthening of the independ*\nence, to all the peoples who\nare fighting for the complete\ndestruction of the colonial sys\ntem.\u201d\nThis policy of aid to various\n; underdeveloped countries has\ni become something of a bone of\ncontention with Red China.

The might of\nsocialism serves peace. Soviet\nexperience has fully borne out\n1 the Marxist-Leninist theory that\n; the Communist party plays a\n' decisive role in the formation\n' and development of socialist\nsociety.\nEconomic Victory Predicted\nThere exists in the world a\nsocialist society that is a reality\nand a science of socialist con\nstruction that has been tested\nin practice. The high road to\nsocialism has been paved and\nI will be taken sooner or later\nby all peoples.\nThe world socialist system is\na new type of economic and\npolitical relationship between\ncountries. Its experience has\nconfirmed the need for the clos\nest unity of countries that fall\ni away from capitalism, for their\nunited effort in the building of\nsocialism and communism.\nThe world socialist system is\nadv %ncing steadfastly toward\ndecisive victory in its economic\ncompetition with capitalism. It\nwill shortly surpass the world\ncapitalist system in aggregate\n'made it clear these will not be\n'abolished. However, it said\n\u2018 eventually the collectives\u2014\nwhich are not to be confused\n\u25a0 with outright state farms\u2014\nwould become so prosperous as\nto allow them to merge their\ncollective property with the\nstate property.\nThe program also said that\neventually the personal plots of\n.collective farmers would grad\nually outlive their economic im\nportance.\nThe program claimed that\nwhen this occurs, the collective\nfarmers would agree to give up\ntheir private plots. These pri\nvate plots now furnish a goodly\nshare of the food consumed in\nthe Soviet Union and for this\nreason there were no drastic\npronouncements about elimi\nnating them. *\nSomething for All\nSomething was promised for\neveryone in the following man\nner:\nj \u201cIn accordance with the\ngrowth of the income of the\npeople there will be a rapid up\nsurge of the total level of the\ni people\u2019s consumption. The en\ni tire puplation will be given the\nopportunity of satisfying their\nrequirements for better and\nmore varied food.\nj. In the nearest future, the\npeoples\u2019 share in animal pro\nduets <meat. fat. milk products)\nwill cons'derably increase, as\nwell as their share of fruit and\nhigher quality vegetables of all\n; classes.\n\"The demand of all levels of\n1 the population for higher quali\nty consumer goods will be satis- .\nfied, including durable and at\ntractive clothes, things which'\nimprove and decorate the every- '\nday life of the Soviet people;\n, durable and modern furniture;\nall kinds of goods for cultural\nneeds.\u201d\nThese sweeping promises con\ncluded: \u201cthe output of auto- \u25a0\n\\ mobiles for the population will\nbe considerably increased.\u2019\u2019\nMM\nindustrial and agricultural pro\nduction.\nThe magnificent edifice of\nthe new world being built by\n, the heroic labors of the free\n[ peoples on vast areas of Europe\n, and Asia is a prototype of a\nnew society, of the future of all\n; mankind.\n1 3d Capitalist Crisis Seen\nWorld capitalism has now\n\u25a0 entered a new. third stage of\n. a general crisis.\nThe principal feature of this\ni new stage is that its develop\n, ment was not due, to a world\nI war.\nThe general crisis of capital-\nI ism finds expression in the\n\u2019 following:\nThe breakaway from Capital\n-1 ism of more and more coun\ntries; the weakening of the im\ni perialist positions in the econo\ni mic competition with socialism;\n\u2019 the breakup of the imperialist\n; colonial system; the intensifi\n, cation of imperialist contradic\n; tions with the development of\nstate-monopoly capitalism and\nthe growth of militarism;\nThe mounting internal in\nstability and decay of capital\nist economy, evidenced by the\nincreasing inability of capital\nism to make use of the produc\ntive forces; low rates of pro\nduction growth, periodic crises,\ncontinuous underloading of\nproduction plant, and chronic\nunemployment; the mounting\nstruggle between labor and\ncapital and acute intensifica\ntion of contradictions within\nthe world capitalist economy,\nand an unprecedented growth\nof political reaction in all\nspheres; rejection of bourgeois\nfreedoms and establishment of\nfascist and despotic regimes in\na number of countries; and the\nprofound crisis of bourgeois\npolicy and ideology.\nU.S. Main Center\nU.S. monopoly capital has be\ncome the biggest international\nexploiter. It is performing the\nfunction of a world gendarme.\nThe economic and with it po\nlitical and military center of\nImperialism, has shifted from\nEurope to the U.S.\nThe U.S. monopoly bourge\noisie is the mainstay of inter\nnational reaction.\nThe U.S.A., the strongest\ncapitalist/ power, is past its\nzenith and has entered the\nstage of decline. Imperialist\ncountries such as Great Britain,\nFrance, Germany and Japan\nhave also lost their former\npower.\nThe antagonism of labor and\ncapital, the contradictions be\ntween the people and the\nmonopolies, growing militarism,\nthe breakup of the colonial sys\ntem, contradictions between im\nperialist countries, conflicts\nand contradictions between the\nyoung national states and the\nold colonial powers, and-rfnost\nimportant of all\u2014the precipit\nous growth of world socialism,\nare sapping and destroying im\nperialism. leading to its weak\nening and collapse.\nPeaceful Revolution Possible\nThe proletarian revolution in\na country, being part of the\nworld socialist revolution, is\naccomplished by the working\nclass of that country and the\nmasses of its people.\nThe revolution is not made\nto order. It cannot be imposed\non the people from without.\nTogether with the other\nMarxist-Leninist parties, the\nCommunist Party of the Soviet\nUnion (CPSUI regards it as its\ninternationalist duty to call on\nthe peoples of all countries to\nprevent imperialist export of\ncounter-revolution.\nCommunists have never held\nthat the road to revolution\nnecessarily lies through wars\nbetween countries. The great\nobjectives of Jhe working class\ncan be realized without world\nwar.

The in\nterview, in the form of ques\ntions and answers, follows:\nQUESTION: What does the\nChancellor think of the sta\ntus of anti-Semitism in the\nGerman Federal Republic?\nANSWER: I am convinced\nthat there is today no anti-\nSemitism in the Federal Re\npublic. The anti-Semitism\npestilence which poisoned re\nlations between the Jews and\nGermans during the Hitler\nregime was a temporary de\nvelopment restricted to Na\ntional Socialism.\nCertainly, from time to\ntime some individual in\nstances of anti-Semitic utter\nances are reported in and\nknocked about by the German\npress. But these occurrences\nax-e few and should not be gen\neralized upon. I am certain\nthat the German people as a\nwhole disapprove of anti-Sem\nitism, anti-Semitic discrimina\ntion or excesses.\nYou probably know that\nthe Federal Government has\nmade it an item of its pro\ngram to achieve reconciliation\nbetween the Jews and the\nGerman people. Not only did\nwe sign and fulfill the restitu\ntion agreement, but for all\nour Jewish fellow\u2019-citizens\nwho returned to Germany we\nalso created the bases for\nthem to feel they are full citi\nzens and so to become accus\ntomed to life in Germany. Not\nonly through laws, but\nthrough measures of enlight\nenment such efforts have\nproven really successful.\nIn conclusion, let me say\nagain: here and there a single\ncase of anti-Semitic attitude\nmay be observed, but in the\nmain there is neither a mass\n;!

This hope was not false.\nRelations between Israel and\nthe German Republic have\nimproved visibly.\nHowever, the final aim\ncomplete normalization of re\nlations on both sides \u2014Las not\nyet been achieved.

Each\nParliamentary election has\nshown that the adherents of\nright-radical groups at the\nmost never amount to more\nthan one or two percent of\nthe constituency taken as a\nwhole. Furthermore, I must\nstress the \u2018time\u2019 factor. In\nspite of the fact that the Ger\nman people still have to carry\nthe heavy burden of the con\nsequences of National Social\nism, that disastrous period is\nalready in the past as long\nas the period that it existed.\nMeanwhile, youth have grown\nup who do not at all remem\nber the time of National So\ncialism.\u201d\nDr. Adenauer said it was\n\u201cvery interesting and often\nnoted, that the growing gen\neration shows no, or very lit\ntle, understanding when Hit\nler\u2019s name is mentioned. All\nthis leads to the conclusion\u2014\nand rightly \u2014that National\nSocialism has been nothing\nbut an unbelievably frightful 1\nevent, the happening of which j\ncan be explained only through j\nthe terrible suffering and ]\nmisery which followed the J\nFirst World War. Today, our |\npolitics of collaboration, I\nknown to us in the West, also l\nprovides the German people \u2019\nwith sufficient work and\nbread, a fact that I believe\nto be the simplest and by far\nthe most effective means to\ndefeat National Socialism for\never.\u201d\nWe Wish the\nCommunity a\nVery Joyous\nChanukah\nfrom\nBernie, Sid and\nFamilies\nTOPPS\nKosher Delicatessen\n1130 E. 6th St.\nPhone MAin 3-6063\npilllllllllllllllllllllllllltllllllllllllllllllll^\n| The MANAGEMENT \u00a7\n1 and STAFF of g\nmold 1\ns s\nand\n(KOLD-TV\nwish the\nJewish Community \u00a7\u00a7\nI A Very Happy j\u00a7\nCHANUKAH\nand\n1 ii\ns Pledge a Continuance =\nM of the fine Programs -\nyou enjoy at\nI i\nJ 1450 ON YOUR DIAl|\nand\nCHANNEL 13\nyGHOST RANCH DINING ROOM:-\n801 CASA GRANDE ROAD Phone MA 4-8261\nDining Out SHOULD Be An Adventure in Good Food\n\u2019 \u2022\nSit yourself down before a Ghost Ranch\nmenu . . . choose a delicately spiced\nsoup ... a Consomme Au Sherry, a Sour\nCream Vichysoisse Frappe or a hearty\nMinestrone . . .\nEnjoy an appetizing Princess Salad, Hearts\nof Palm or a crisp Tossed Salad with a\nchoice of dressings. . . .\nThen select a mouth-watering entree . . .\nRoast Tenderloin of Beef, Wellington . . .\nFabulous Ghost Ranch . . .\nWhere Dining IS An Adventure in Good Food!\n\u2022 Prescriptions\n\u2022 PACKAGE GOODS \u2022 CAMERAS\n\u2022 COSMETICS \u2022 FOUNTAIN SERVICE I\nl\u00bbk BROADWAY VILLAGERS?

ZAIDMAN\nLONDON\u2014The British Gen\neral Elections are over and the\nresults are by now well known.\nDespite the 1.200.000 increase\nin the labour vote, over that of\n1945, when the vote was 12.000.-\n000, the number of members of\nParliament elected is very much\nreduced. Instead of 390 members\nof Parliament previously, with an\nover-all majority of 150 over all\nthe other parties, there are now\nonly 315, an over-all majority of\nseven. The Tories increased their\nnumber of members of Parlia\nment from 240 to 296 and their\nvote from 9.800.000 to 12.200.000,\nThe Liberal Party polled 2.600.000\nand obtained nine seats. The Tor\nies are rejoicing over their vic\ntory, though they show no haste\nto force anew election and make\na Labour Government impossible.\nAll is set for a Coalition, if not\nin form, then in fact, but tacit\nagreement.\nThe Vilest Propaganda\nThe Communist candidates who\nfought against the vilest and\nfoulest anti-Communist and anti-\nSoviet propaganda, received a\nOhio C.

In the 100 constitu\nencies where communist candi\ndates stood 91.000 eleotors only\nshowed sufficient political con\nsciousness and understanding to\nvote for the Communist electoral\nprogramme; the only programme\nshowing the way forward for\nBritain, threatened as it is, more\nand more with economic and so\ncial crisis.\nWarnings about the impending\ndisaster, are more frequent, and\ncalls are made about the need to\nrally together and face unitedly\nthe dire future. The Liberal\n\u201cStar\u201d, a London evening paper\nwrites:\n\u201cWhat we have to do is to\nmaintain our general standard\nof living. That depends on\nwhat we can produce and\nwhether we can export enough\nto get back in return the food\nand raw materials we want.\nThe fundamental solution rests\nin more and efficient and\ncheaper production. That alone\nwill permit us to secure eco\nnomic happiness.\u201d (27-2-50)\nThe Tory \u201cEvening News\u201d\nwrites in the same vein:\n\u201cThere are certain firm if\nmatically shown in the bill intro\nduced by Senator Mundt to out\nlaw thought,\n(We the Americans of Roman\nian origin would like to know if\nSen.

But\nthe wage freeze is supposed to\nremain for the rest of the\nyear.\u201d (27-2-50)\nBy writing in this way, these\npapers, and as many others do,\necho what the \u201cObserver\u201d wrote\non February 12th:\n\u201cWhatever we do at home, as\na nation we shall for years con\ntinue to UVe amidst unprece\ndented perils, and we shall have\nto make unprecedented efforts\nin thought and action to deal\nwith them. No obvious or easy\nsolution is in sight.\u201d\nThe C. P. Warning\nIt was against these threats\nto the standard of living of the\nworking people and the drive to\nwar that the Communist Party\nwas warning the working class. In\nundertaking this task the Com\nmunist Party realised that it was\nno easy matter to win the working\nclass away from the influences\nand hold of reformism. In Febru\nary 1049, when the Executive\nCommittee of the Communist\nParty met to consider future elec\ntoral policy of the Party and to\ndecide on the number of Com\nmunist candidates, Harry Pollitt,\nthe General Secretary, spoke of\nthe absence of greater mass op\nposition to the policy of the em\nployers and the Labour Govern\nment. He said then:\n\u201cThere are two answers to\nthis question. First, there is a\ntremendous and instinctive\nclass loyalty among the w*g<-\ners which expresses itself in\nsupport of the Labour Govern\nment, whose greatest political\ncrime is that it squanders this\nsplendid support. At the same\ntime we must recognise the dif\nference between the elementary\nclass feeling, often expressed in\nbitter fights for wages and con\nditions, and the fundamental\nunderstanding of the principles\nof class struggle, allied to the\naim of winning complete po\nlitical power over the capitalist\nclass and laying the founda\ntions for Socialism in Britain.\n\u201cFor decades the British\nworking class, particularly the\nskilled craftsman, has been a\nprivileged section, enjoying\nhigher standards than other\nworking classes in the world\nowing to conditions that can\nnever occur again. First, we\nmust remember the Industrial\nRevolution and the fact that\nBritain became the \u2018workshop\nof the world\u2019; and second, the\nshameful exploitation of a vast\nempire which gave a section of\nthe British workers standards\nof living that were maintained\nat the expense of millions of\ncolonial slaves. This was the\nbasis of opportunism and So\ncial-Democracy In Britain.\n\u201cIt would, moreover, be de\nliberate political blindness on\nbur part if we did not recognise\nas a second reason for the lack\nof mass resistence to the present\nGovernment the fact that many\npeople still believe that there Is\na difference between the domes\ntic and foreign policies of the\nlabour leaders.\u201d\nThat these reformist ideas still\nprevail amongst the majority of\nBritish workers has been proven\nover and over again at the gen\neral elections which have just\ntaken place. The majority of the\nBritish working class associate\ntheir social .advance and the\nstruggle for maintaining their\npresent conditions with support\nfor the Labour Party. Asa result\nof political developments in Brit\nain the Labour Party is using the\n\u201cexploitation of the vast empire\u201d\nas a means of maintaining the\nprivileged position of the Biritsh\nworkers.\n(To be continued)\nof 8,000 hours was saved in build\ning this barge.\n\u2022\u25a0\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nTechnicians and employees' of\nSovromtransport shipyards.

He was the special Sunday\nevening speaker over the Canadian\nbroadcasting system. He boldly, de\nclared that the primary cause of the\ntensions in our age were caused by\nhunger. He said that more than one\nhalf of the people of the world were\npoverty stricken and hungry.\nIn recent years he had traveled in\nAsia, Africa and South American and\nhad seen the deplorable conditions in\nthese continents.\nHe said that if every communist in\nthe world were to drop dead of heart\nfailure tomorrow morning, that the\nrevolutionary drive would continue. It\nis to be remembered that John Scott\nin his book, some years ago, made a\nsimilar statement. He said that if some\ncataclysm of nature were to sink Rus\nsia under the waters of the Arctic\nocean that the revolutions would con\ntinue.\nStringefllow Barr thinks that the\nmethods we are using are worse than\nuseless .To make war on these back\nward countries only produces more\npoverty and hunger and therefore more\ncommunists.\nOur arms program, when we produce\narms instead of butter, achieves the\nsame end. He says that to talk to a\nhungry man ' about freedom is just\nfoolish.\nI want to add that Stringfellow Barr\nneeds to go a step further behind the\npoverty and hunger and get after the\ncauses that produce it.\nIn all of these backward countries:\nfind that much the same conditions\nexists. In most of them, Americans and\nEuropeans have acquired the owner\nship of many of their natural resources\nand are exploiting' the cheap labor of\nthese countries.\nThese private investors have allied\nthemselves with the corrupt, inefficient\ngovernments of the feudalistic land\nlords in order to protect themselves in\nthe ownership and management of\ntheir properties.\nThe moneys paid to these rulers have\nstrengthened their hold and made it\npossible to better hold their people in\nsubjection.\nAll across Southern Asia and in Af\nrica, from north to south, and in many\nof the countries of Latin America un\nrest is rising, and their people are\ncoming to a determination to put an\nend to these twin exploiters.\nW I \u25a0\nThe poem \"The Man With the Hoe\"\nby Edwin Markham is an eloquent des\ncription of what is happening in our\nworld today.

(self\nstyled \"Your Electric Co.) Just here\nI wish to say that the term is a mis\nnomer, you consumers have certainly\npaid for it but you are still a long\nway from owning it. It might be of\nConsiderable interest to investigate\nthe record of profits made by this\ncompany in the last year or two in\nMontana alone. Just remember while\nyou are doing so that these recorded\nprofits are profits accrued after all\nexpenses of generation, distribution,\nsalaxies, wages, replacement, depreci\nation, and new equipment have been\npaid.\nNow the Montana Power Com\npany's (\"Your Electric Co.\") pet\npeeve about \"creeping socialism\" is\nthe \"co-ops\" particularly the Rural\nElectric Administration co - opera\ntives, because they, according to\n\"Your Electric Co's.\" propaganda, in\ntex-fere with the individual initiative\nor \"free enterprise\" of private elec\ntric companies. (How many of those\nare there in Montana?)\nYour Electric Co.\" through ad\nvertisements and the NTEA propa\nganda hux-ls anathema and invective\nat all co-ops as \"creeping socialism\"\nand endeavors through legislative ac\nco-ops in their development.\nThe question arises then, ax-e these\nco-ops a form of \"creeping social\nism?\" The answer to that must be a\nfx-ank yes. One of the fundamental\nprinciples of socialism is democratic\nco-operation. That far the NTEA\nand \"Your Electric Co's.\" propaganda\nis factual but they do not tell you\nwhat brought about the organization\nof these co-ops or why they are\nconstantly increasing in number (it\nis barely possible that the propagand\nists are too simple to know, but I\nhai'dly think so.)\nTo best illustrate the reason for\nthese co - operatives and their\nconstant increase despite the or\nganized opposition I will cite a\nspecific instance which occurs in\nthe immediate locality in which I\nreside and which is comparable to\ndozens, yes probably thousands of\nsmiliar cases throughout the state.\n\"Your Electric Co.\" has a dam and\ngenexating plant at Thompson Falls\ngenerating approximately 35,000 kw\nand a transmission line for this power\nextending up Prospect cxeek over\nBurke hill to Wallace and Kellog\nwith a substation at Crow creek, 13\nmiles up Prospect ci'eek from Thomp\nson Falls.\nhad tided to induce\nFor several years, prior to my resi\ndence on Prospect creek, the x'esi\ndents in this valley, most of them\nhaving land immediately adjacent to\nor actually crossed by this power line,\nYour Electric\nCo.\" to provide them with elecric\nservice, but the result was \"no dice.\n\"Your Electric Co.\" refused and even\nat the Crow creek substation such\nitt\n\"\nelectric light as was to be had (for\ntwo residences and other buildings)\nwas provided by a Delco plant and\ngas engine.\nNow while I am a confirmed soc\nialist, albeit not the \"creeping\" kind,\nand prefer the co-opei'ative method\nto our so-called \"free enterprise.\"\nI am still something of a \"crank\nabout efficiency and dislike to see\nan unnecessai'y duplication of ef\nfort or facilities, so I had hoped\nthat \"Your Electric Co.\" having al\nready a pole line consti'ucted would\nsee the logic and common sense in\nproviding this service under the \"free\n(?) enterprise\" system. However, af\nter a pei'iod of several years it be\ncame evident that this was either\nbeyond their comprehension or was\nan immaterial consideration so\u2014\n\"Creeping socialism\" started\n\"creeping\" up Prospect creek.\nSomething over a year ago, I along\nwith other residents of the area final\nly decided that \"the American way\nof life.\nElectric Co.\nimmediately concerned about per\nforming a service which a public\nutility is organized for and assumed\nto provide in the territory through\nwhich it passes. Consequently we\ncame to the conclusion that if such\nservice was to be provided it would\nhave to be done by socialist methods\nregardless of the fact that it meant\nan inefficient duplication of power\nlines and we began a correspond\nas exemplified by \"Your\nwas not greatly or\nP '\n' '\nence with a \"creeping REA co-op\"\nwhich had a terminal within some\ntwo miles of Prospect creek valley\nand negotiations were progressing to\na point where with the signing of\nsome contracts this co-op would un\ndertake the building of the line and\nproviding the service.\nWhether through mental telepathy\nor through some subtle sixth sense\n(?) provided by the American way\nof life for the deserving free enter\npriser \"Your Electric Co.\" discovered\nthat vile subversives were making an\neffort to und.ex-mine private initiative\nand destroy \"rugged individualism^\"\nand decided that \"Your Electric Co.\"\nwould string a low voltagq line up\nthe creek as far as the substation so\nthat the company substation would\nnot have to depend on \"creeping\nsocialism\" for lighting \"Your Electric\nCo's.\" buildings and grounds. This\nlow voltage line is now complete\nand furnishing light and power to\nthe substation 13 miles up the val\nley.\nImmediately upon the completion\nof this low voltage line we decided\nthat since our negotiations with the\nco-op REA were not yet complete\nit might be advisable, to avoid dupli\ncation of lines to again contact \"Your\nElectric Co.\" which we did in late\nSeptember. The residents of the val\nley met with representatives of\nYour Electric Co.\" for a discussion.\nu\nRepresentatives of \"Your Electric\nCo.\" stated that they were reluctant\nto connect these x'esidences since the\nlow voltage line was on the poles of\nthe high power line and since they\nmight have to make repairs at times\nto that line we might be deprived of\npower for some days at a time.\nThis reluctance we could of course\nunderstand and we stated that we\ncould recognize the problem and wex-e\nwilling to sign a special agreement\ncovering that possibility since we\nwould much pi'efer to have the ser\nvice even tho temporarily interrupted\nthan to be without it entirely.\nThis seemed to satisfy them and\nallay their fears and we left the\nconference with the feeling that\nthe agreements would be prepared\nand we would have the service with\nin a short time. However, within\nabout two w.eeks one of their local\nmen was called from headquarters\non the phone and told that the an\nswer was NO. Again we contacted\n\"Your Electric Co's.\" regional rep\nresentatives with no satisfaction.\nThen by correspondence (register\nwe wrote the president and\nthe public relations representative\nand at this time, about six weeks,\nwe have not been accorded even\nthe courtesy of a reply. So the\nmatter stands.\n.\u00ab\u25a0*\nThe low voltage line is in opera\ntion, there are a dozen residents\nwhose lands are either adjae'ent to or\ncrossed by the line, all desire the\nservice but apparently if we are to\nhave the service it will have to be\nprovided by the \"creeping socialism\"\nmethods.\ned)\nIt seems to me that \"Your Elec\ntric Co.\" by such methods is con\ntributing largely to the \"creeping\nsocialism\" of which they so vocif\nerously complain in their odorifer\nous advertisements.\nNow I have cited this particular\ninstance as one example of the meth\nods of \"Your Electric Co.\" Howevex',\nthis is only a single instance there\nare many others and at anotheir\ntime I propose to expose another case\nwhich has come under my observation\nwhere methods even more odoriferous\nwere utilized by these defendex-s of\nthe \"American Way of Life.\"\nJointly Financed\nMontana's x-ehabilitation program\nis financed jointly by the state and\nthe nation, but Federal dollars out\nnumber state dollars by more than\ntwo to one."}, {"title": "daily record.", "city": ["Dunn"], "date": "19511015", "raw_text": "PAGE TWO\n(lire JHailg Jlmrrd\nit;\"!

Jr. is of the\ngeneration that must take over the\nmanagement of Uric country during\nthe next ten years or so. Grad\nuated from Yale in 1950, he had\nmade quite a record for himself\nas editor of the \u2018Yale Daily News,\u201d\nas a debater and as a student.\nBuckley was driven by our con\nfused world and the broken lives\nof our sons to wonder what he got\nat Yale in the way of an educa\ntion. That is an upsetting ques\ntion for a young reiiow because\nthen he has to ask himself what\nan education is.\nWhy dees one go to college? Is\nit to get facts which can be culled\nout of books? Is it to meet ath\nletic people such as appear nightly\nat Toots Shor\u2019s Bar? Is it to build\ncharacter,, to gain inspiration, to\npound oqt a personality?\nHaving pondered over these\nquestions, young Buckley wrote a\nbook, \u201cGod and Man at Yale,\u201d\nwhich every parent who has a son\nor a daughter at college should\nread, study and think about.\nFor this is not an old man talk\ning about a messed up or a lost\ngeneration. This is a young man\nwho loves his college and who\nachieved distinction in it and who\nis describing its composition, its\npersonnel, its responsibilities.\nPerhaps. Buckley\u2019s dedication\ntells the whole story. It is \u201cfor\nGod, for country, and for Yale, in\nthat order.\u201d And the order is the\npoint of the book. If Yale does\nnot serve God and country, what\ndoes it serve? Or what does Har\nvard or Columbia or Dartmouth or\nany other college serve? Buckley\nmakes his position clear in this\nstatement:\n.1 contended that the trus\ntees of Yale, along with the vast\nmajority of the alumni, are com\nmitted to the desirability of fos\ntering both a belief in God, and\na recognition of the merits of our\nA JANE AND A JOE\nIn the cool, cool of the evening of the day on which Joe DiMaggio\nbelted his first homerun of the World Series, Jane Pickens belted\na home run of her own on the stage of the Ziegfield Theatre. There\nthe similarity ends.\nThe brothers of Joe DiMaggio have played no part in his career,\nwhile pursuing their own careers. The sisters of Jane Pickens played\na large part in her career by abandoning their original road maps. If\nthe other two Pickens sister hadn\u2019t gotten married, it is possible that\nJane would not have been cavorting in \"Music in the Air,\u201d revived\nby Oscar Hammerstein 19 years after its original opening in 1932.\nIncidentally, another New York Yankee team was co-star in a\nlarge part in her career by abandoning their original road maps. If\nthe World Series of 1932. Behind the home run hitting of Babe Ruth\nand Lou Gehrig, the Yankees beat the Chicago Cubs in four strainght\ngames. That whs Babe Ruth's last World Series, made even more\nmemorable by the historic fact that Babe poled one of his homers\ninto the bleachers, after pointing to the exact spot where he intended\nto belt it\nBaseball fans got the same sort of kick out of DiMaggio\u2019s home\nrun bout.\nFor the first three games of the Series, in twelve trips to the plate,\nthe San Franciscan had gone hitless. Several times, DiMaggio had\nclouted the ball well, but the Giant outfielders flagged the blows before\nthey could get into the stands.\nEven New York Giants fans. I think were rooting for DiMaggio\nto snap out of his slump because it is generally conceded that few\nmodem players have contributed so much to the popularity of baseball\nas the quiet-spoken Coaster.\nPreceding the fourth game, DiMaggio told reporters that Lefty\nOTioul and Lew Fonseca, at his request, had picked out certain flaws\nin his swing. O'Doul felt that DiMaggio was getting his body into the\nswing to such an extent that the ball wasn\u2019t getting through, an anal\nysis supported by Fonseca\u2019s study of early moving pictures he had\nmade of DiMaggio. It was typical of DiMaggio\u2019s baseball savvy that\nwhen he needed advice on hitting, he went to two players who had led\ntheir leagues in hitting. In 1929 O\u2019Doul lead the National League\nhitters with a mark of .398; Fonseca lead the American League with\na .369.\nThat afternoon DiMaggio did his mentors proud by whaling the\nball with his old-time vigor.\nJane Pickens is even more memorable. Whatever she has accom\nplisher in the theatre has been done the hard way\u2014on her own.\nDiMaggio started out endowed with a tremendous natural equip\nment. Baseball was as natural to him as walking or breathing. He\nwas a great star in his first season in minor league baseball and when\nhe moved up to the American League, in 1936, he celebrated his first\nseason with a batting average of .323.\nJane Pickens started out modestly enough with her two sisters as\na harmony trio. They were very good but not sensational, in the same\nbracket with the Boswell Sisters. When the Pickenses dissolved their\npartnership, because of the marriage of two of the girls, the determined\nJane started all over again as a single. Because of a certain coldness,\nsome doubted that she\u2019d make the grade in a phase of the profession\nwhich places a hig premium on personality.\nJane\u2019s personal montage would .\u2018(how a series of stops from one\nend of the country to the other. She\" sang in night clubs, theatres, mu\nsical comedies, and every other place which boasted a microphone. Bit\nby bit, the hard way, she was learning her trade. Whatever money\nshe earned was re-invested in gowns and lessons, a smart wardpjDe\nbeing a must for any girl performer. Now and then, when she'd coifte\nto New York, you\u2019d find that she had added a male choral background\nto her act, in an attempt to achieve the stardom which she hunted so\nearnestly. She spent a lot of money for press agents.\nThen one night last season, Jane stepped out on the stage of the\n43th St. Theatre in the title role of \u201cRegina.\" the operatic version of\n\u201cThe Little Foxes.\u201d\nSne was a sensational success, both as singer and actress. Watch\ning her, you marveled at the fantastic strides which she'd made on her\npilgrimage throughout the country. Here was a brillant, well-rounded\nperformance by a girl who had developed poise and warmth and\nauthority, i\nIn \"Music in the Air,\" Jane Pickens goes even beyond \"Regina\u201d\nand established herself as one of the top-flight artists in her field. Play\ning with such capable veterans as Dennis King, adroit Charles Win\nninger and Conrad Nagel, she not only holds her own, but occasionally\nwrests the stage away from them completely.\nThe amazing fact Is that within the space of a year, she moved\nfrom the morbidity demanded in \u201cRegkia\u201d to the comedy demandtd in\n\"Music In the Air,\u201d making the transition as smoothly as a bolt of\nsilk unrolls,\nTHE DAILY RECORD, DUNN, N.

I therefore con\ncluded that as our educational\noverseers, it was the clear respon\nsibility of the trustees to guide the\nteaching at Yale toward those\nends.\u201d\nThe charge will undoubtedly be\nmade that Buckley is a religious\nbigot. What Buckley found at Yale, i\nhowever, is atheistic bigotry;\namoral biogtry; anti-capitalistic\nbigotry. It would seem to be intol\nerable to hold to one\u2019s faith, but\ntolerable to oppose all religion; it\nwould seem to be cultural to stim\nulate curiosity concerning the va\nrieties of socialism but reactionary\nto believe in the economic and so\ncial system which developed our_\nAmerica over three centuries.\nThe question that tms young\nman raises cannot be put down by\ndenouncing his religious beliefs or\nhis church affiliations, whatever\nthey may be. His basic question\nis why our universities devote so\nmuch of their teaching time to a\ndenunciation of so much that is\nfundamentally American.\nAnri this question our colleges\nwill have to answer to the parents\nof the students and to'the alumni\nof these schools. John Chamber\nlain. in an introduction to this\nbook, says:\n\u201cProfessor Henry Steele Comma\nger of Columbia University, who\nthinks that the university facul\nties. not the alumni or the parents\nof the students, should have final\ncontrol over the aims of educa\ntion, has virtually stated that the\ncustomer has no rights in the edu\ncational market place. Pursued to\nits logical conclusion, the Comma\nger theory would end by setting\nup an elite of professorial un\ntouchables. The elite would per\npetuate itself as it chose. . . .\u201d\nPrecisely that condition pre\nvails. By shrieking \u201cacademic free\ndom!\" The professors raise a false\nissue. For the charge against them\noften does not involve limitations\nupon freedom but upon the prop\nagation of falsehood. For instance,\nthe professor who said: \u201cChaplains\naccompanying modern armies are\ncomparable to witch doctors ac\ncompanying tribes.\u201d may have been\nignorant but it is more likely that\nhe is a liar. And while his lie gets\nhim a laugh, it does neither his\ncountry nor the students any\ngood.\nThis is an important matter for\nparents, for while each one be\nlieves that his son or daughter\ncould not be that way, the fact is\nthat boys and girls of excellent\nfamilies are nqw in jail for acting\nas Stalin's agents against their\nown country. If it could happen\nto the Hiss family, it could happen\nto yours. And every investigation\ninto the background of these\nsmart, well-bred spies and traitors\nleads to the influences they en\ncountered in college.\nFor this reason William F.

For a get\nwell present his office staff bought\nhim a television set.\nHe wasn't interested. But he did\nsnap it on one night and, first\nthing you know, TV became a habit\nwith the Senator. The more he\nlooked at it, the more he enjoyed\nit. Only one thing pained him;\nall those ads for U. S. Savings\nBonds.\nWhy, said he, there were almost\nas many animated dodgers for\nbonds as there were for George\ntown beer (a well-advertised local\nbrand).\n\u201cIt was as though our govern\nment were in the last throes of\ntrouble,\u201d continued the Tennessee\nstatesman \u201cThat we had to sell\nthese bonds, or we were going to\nthe bow-wows.\"\nJohn S. Graham, Assistant Sec\nretary of Treasury, said his bond\nadvertisements were prepared by\nsome of the greatest advertising\ngeniuses in America. Maybe so. re\ntorted the Senator, but he believed\nthe beer clugs were better.\nSen. McKellar who is chairman\nof the Appropriations Committee,\nsiad what did the Treasury mean\nby asking for 32,000,000 to adver\ntise bonds? Graham said that\nwasn't it at all With the money\nhe needed to hire salesmen; the\nadvertising was donated. Sen. McK.\nwas not convinced.\n\u201cGeorgetown beer is advertised\n\"Georgetown beer is advertised\nvery regularly, but, my heavens,\nwhen it comes to advertising\nTreasury bonds, savings bonds and\nthis and that kind of bonds it\nlooks like our government is in\ndire straits,\u201d he continued. \"If you\nare paying for experts I would iike\nto know the experts.\u201d\nHe wasn\u2019t paying \u2019em, Graham\nsaid Then, said the Senator, why\ndid he need $2 000,000? Poor Gra\nham. He seemed to be having no\nbetter luck with the Senate than\nthe House committee, which had\nknocked the money for bond-sell\ning out of his appropriation.

One minor crash and\none hit and run, were all that\nwere reported.\nThe crash occurred Saturday at\n11:20 a. m\u201e when a 1951 Chevrolet\ntaxi collided with a 1941 Ford, at\nthe intersection of North Magnolia\nand East Surles.\nThe Ford, driven by Charlie Par\nker of Dunn Route 5 was attempt\ning to make a right turn from\nMagnolia into Surles. Damage to\nthe taxi was about ten dollars and\nthe car about five dollars.\nHIT-RUN CASE\nThe hit and run report came\nfrom Warren Strickland, who to'd\nofficers that a 1940 Chevrolet, driv\ning without lights, hit his parked\ncar, damaging the left rear fen\nder.\nCheck of the license reported by\nStrickland, revealed that the car\nwas owned by Lester House of Er\nwin, and a warrant for his ar\nrest was issued\nGraham said the small bonds\nwere selling fine, but the la\\ge\nones weren\u2019t doing so well. The\nSenator said he wanted a better\nanswer. Graham said he could sell\nbonds to banks, all right.\n\"I\u2019m not talking about banks,\u201d\nsaid the gentleman fro Tennes\nsee. Sen. Allen J. Ellender (D\u201e\nLa.) said why didn\u2019t Graham just\nadmit the people weren\u2019t buying\nas many bonds as he\u2019d like and\nthat was why he hired several\nhundred salesmen? Graham admit\nted it.\nThis seems to have been a mis\ntake. Sen: McKellar charged him\nwith hirirg 500 bond peddlers for\n$2,000,000 a year without first ask\ning Congress if this was a good\nidea. Graham said the House did\napprove their hire. Then, demand\ned the Senator, why didn\u2019t the\nHouse approve their $2,000,000\nwages?\nAll the money didn\u2019t go for\nwages, said the harried Graham.\nSome of .it went for radio tran\nscriptions and films to be donated\nto television stations. Aha, said the\nSenator. So some of this money\ndid go for advertising?\nYes, said Graham\u2019s helper, Bill\nMcDonald, these films advertised\nbonds via TV two or three times\na week. \u201cNot quite as often as\nGeorfetown beer?\u201d inquired the\nSenator.\n\u201cNot quite,\" said McDonald.\nSo I guess if you want to buy\na bond, you\u2019d better get in touch\nwith the Treasury.

Even on the crowded stage of French politics,\nlie stood apart from the pushing swirling crowd of men who\nrose to eminence and fell, towering above so many of his con\ntemporaries, loved, respected, admired, hated and feared.\nHe stood for many things in France and the world\u2014above\nall, for an order of decency in man\u2019s relations with man. He\nrepresented, in himself, that era in man\u2019s progress, which now\nseems so remote, when man hoped for steady progress, a\ngradual betterment and a growth of the human spirit to ever\nhigher levels. That Blum, aged and ailing, but still undis\ncouraged was \u201cout of the news\u201d for so long before his death,\nthis his voice, the Socialist daily, \u201cLe Populaire,\u201d was barely\nstruggling to survive, is a measure of the frustration of those\nhigh hopes in the world today.\nBlum was a man of many paradoxes. Son of a wealthy\nbourgeois family, he inherited the mantle of Jean Jaures as\nleader of French Socialism and was the lynch-pin of that\nmovement for two decades.\nThe symbol of Gallic intellectualism, the typical caricature\nof a Frenchman, he was nevertheless a Jew to the core, proud\ncf it, deeply interested in all aspects of Jewish life, a supporter\ncf Jewish aspirations in Palestine. An idealist, a dreamer and\na visionary, he was a realist, a hard-boiled politician, a master\nof French parliamentary maneuvre and a dangerous foe in de\nbate. Frail-looking and timid in appearance, he was a man\nof iron courage who did not hesitate to denounce Petain when\nthe aged Marshal betrayed France to Hitler or to condemn\nthe court which sat in judgment on him at Riom during his\ncaptivity.\nYears in Nazi prisons could not shatter his great spirit\nthough they succeeded in destroying his health. He emerged\nfrom prison to play a great role, though briefly, in French life,\nbefore the rigors he had undergone, mastered his frail body.\nSaid John Gunther of Blum some years ago, in what\nmakes a fitting epitaph for this great Jew, great Frenchman\nand citizen of the world:\n'\"His career represents a triumph of decency and reason\nand humanism in a world gone mostly mad.\"\nExtremely interesting views\non Jews and Judaism are ex\npressed by Dr. Albert Einstein\nin his \u201cOut Os My Later Years,\u201d\njust published by the Philosophi\ncal Library ...

Thef\npears might be\u2018of unequal size,\nso she would cut each pear in two\nand give each child a half of\neach.\nBlum read Karl Marx and be\ncame a Socialist, but he was a\nSocialist in the French way. To\nbe sure, France, today, has a\nstrong Communist party, and\nthere is no telling where circum\nstances may lead France, but his\ntorically French Socialists have\nbeen on the moderate side. The\ngreat pre-Marxian French Social,\nist, Fourier, went so far as to con\ntend that \"force is fragile\" and to\nresort to it \"denotes the absence\nof genius.\" Blum's Socialism was\nsomething akin to Roosevelt's\nNew Deal or to the Socialism of\nDavid Ben Gurion.\nIn the case of Harold Laski, we\nhave a man of an enffrely differ\nent sort. Laski never held polit\nical office. He shone by the sheer\nforce of his intellectuality. While\nBlum was vehemently opposed to\nthe Soviets, Laski pleaded for a\nmore sympathetic attitude toward\nthe U. S. S. R., although there\nseems some evidence that his visit\nto Moscow somewhat disillusioned\nhim with Communism. He con\ntinued to the last to see a future\nfor the world only in a pure form\nof Socialism, while Blum thought\nrather of purging the present sys-.\ntem of its evil features.\nLaski's general brilliance was\nsuch as to make him peculiarly\nattractive\u2014even to many who re\njected his conclusions in toto.\nThe late Justice Oliver Wendell\nHolmes, for instance, who despite\nall of his liberalism, could not be\nremotely thought of as having any\ntolerance for Socialism, for a\nnumber of years carried on a cor\nrespondence with Laski.\nconviction that this great re\nspect for intellectual striving is\nsolely responsiole for the contri\nbutions that the Jews have made\ntoward the progress of know\nledge, in the broadest sense of\nthe term . . . The Jews are, thus,\nto him a community of tradition\n... He denies that the Jews pre\nsent a race ... He is of the opin\nion that they are, beyond doubt,\na mixed race . . . Assertions to\nthe contrary, he says, all belong\nto the field of political propa\nganda ... He also comes to the\nconclusion that, perhaps even\nmore than on its own tradition,\nthe Jews have thrived on oppres\nsion and on the antagonism they\nhave forever met in the world ...\nHere, he asserts, lies one of the\nmain reasons for the continued\nexistence of Jews for many\nthousands of years ... He analy\nzes anti-Semitism in the United\nStates, and establishes that so\nfar anti-Semitism has failed in\nthis country, because of the\nsound political instinct of the A\nmerican people ... He thinks\nthat Judaism owes a great debt\nto Zionism, because the Zionist\nmovement has revived among\nJews the sense of community\nand has performed productive\nwork in Israel surpassing any\nexpectations . . .

Boucher .Owner-Publisher\nEntered as second class matter October 14, 1943, at the postoffice\nat Nome, Alaska, under the Act of March 3, 1879.\nNome, Alaska, Friday, August 12, 1949\nALASKA\u2019S FINANCES NOT SO BAD\n(Wragell Sentinel)\nIn comparison with the State of Washington, and a\ngood many other States for that matter, the Territory\u2019s\nmuch discussed financial situation isn\u2019t as bad as it\nsometimes sounds. Down in Washington State, they\nfind themselves in the red about sixty million dollars\nand reports indicate that Gov. Arthur B. Langlie prob\nably will call a special session of the Legislature this\nfall or winter to try and find a solution. Washington al\nready has a sales tax, a property tax and many otheF\nkinds of taxes that the Territory has not yet found\nnecessary. It has to find new sources of revenue or\nboost the ante on the existing sources. Alaska, on the\nother hand, has tapped the sources for sufficient income\nbut finds itself temporarily embarrassed because of\ncourt action over certain provisions of the new tax laws.\nWith the income tax law held valid, money is now com\ning in at a good rate to the tax collector but it takes a\nlittle time. Aside from special funds, the Territory\u2019s es\ntimated revenue for the next six months including next\nJanuary is $4,296,000. This doesn\u2019t include about $600,\n000 which might come in from the fish trap tax if a\ncourt decision is favorable. Against the four million\nplus, the Territory owes a million and a quarter in un\npaid bills against the general fund and Territorial Treas\nurer Henry Boden estimates the operating expenses for\nthe next six months at $1,050,000. Therefore, come the\nend of January and the Territory\u2019s general fund should\nbe a million or so to the good. Of course, this is on the\npremise that the Board of Administration will not thaw\nout any of the approximately five and a half million it\ntied up in the recent \u201cbig freeze.\u201d This the Board by\nresolution has agreed to. It is the premise on which\nTreasurer Roden is now going to the banks with the\nproposition that the banks take general fund warrants\nat face value until enough money comes into the treas\nury to meet them which, he anticipated will not be later\nthan January. In fact, he\u2019s set January 20, 1950, as the\ndate he\u2019ll be able to meet all obligations the banks may\nhold in warrants. Treasurer Roden summed it up in a\nfew words the other day before he took off to talk to\nSeattle banks on his proposal:\n\u201cThis situation is temporary only; there is enough\nrevenue in sight to pay all debts of the Territory if the\nresolution of the Board of Administration is adhered to,\nand this will be done without doubt!\u201d\nWHO\u2019S A SOCIALIST?\n(Christian Science Monitor)\nWhat\u2019s black for the pot is black for the kettle.\nWhile Governor Dewey in a New York speech was\ncomplaining about \u201cpet projects of socialism\u201d that\nmight interfere with the success of the Marshall Plan\nin Europe, Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin of the social\nist government in Britain was complaining to the House\nof Commons about the effects of American socialism on\nBritish purchasing power. The irony is not only amus\ning but instructive.\nMr. Bevin said that one of the reasons for the British\ndollar shortage is that the United States is a \u201cwelfare\nstate,\u201d with high unemployment insurance, sick pay,\nand the possibility of a huge medical service:\n\u201cThe United States is as much a welfare state as\nwe are, only it is in a different form.\u201d\nThen he cited a specific cause of the dollar drain in\nBritain. Government-supported agricultural price in\nthe United States are causing Britain to spend more\ndollars than the British would like to for food.\nThis comparison between the phases of the British\nand American way is provocative. Explored a little fur\nther, it leads us to the fact that American farmers base\ntheir demands for price supports partly on the fact that\n| \u201cU. S.

L. Kask, chairman of the\nCanadian Fisheries Research\nBoard told in an interview of a\nnight-fishing expedition he went\non during a visit to Russia last\nfall.\nOn the Caspian Sea, Kask was\naboard a research vessel which lo\ncated huge schools of Kilna\u2014an\nanchovy type of fish\u2014at a depth\nof 170 feet with an electro-sonic\ndetector.\nFour powerful electric lights i\nattached to an eight-inch rubber j\nhose reinforced with wire mesh\nwere lowered into the water. The\nhose was attached to a pump\naboard the vessel.\n\u201cFish attracted by the lights\nto the mouth of the hose were\npumped into the boat at a rate of\none ton an hour,\u201d Kask said. \u201cThe\ncatch for the night was 10 tons.\u201d\nHe said methods of this type\nhave helped make Russia the\nworld\u2019s second largest fish pro\nducer behind Japan. He said the\ntechniques were not unknown to\nCanada or other nations, but were\nnot being used elsewhere chiefly\nbecause they were too costly.\nKask also said the Russians\nhave been successful in using a\nsubmarine to study commercial\nfish in the Barents Sea and the\nNorth Atlantic. He was shown\nfilm taken from the submarine of\nherring schools and concentrations\nof cod.

No doubt mistakes\nhave been made; what we voters want\nto know is who would have avoided\nthe mistakes and how?\nI myself think one tremendous mis\ntake has been made during the last\nmain party to that mistake. For many\nyears and especially during and after\nthe last war there has been a move\nment toward socialism in democratic\nEurope. The Scandinavian countries\nare considerably socialistic and are\nfinely progressive and democratic under\nthat socialism. England has made far\nbetter recovery under socialism than\nhave any of the other European states\nthat we have been pressuring to make\nhold on to our American patterns of\nfree enterprise.\nEast night in his radio speech Mr.\nStassen disparaged socialism. And was\nit not Mr. Stassen himself who urged\nsome months ago that we give England\nno more financial aid if she %yas going\nto go on with socialism? Mr. Stassen,\nlike the editorial writer of our Daily\nMissoulian, is party to the spread of\nconfusion that lets many Americans be\nlieve that English socialism and Rus\nsian communism are about one and the\nsame thing.\nThis confusion and the resulting re\nsentments both here and abroad can\neasily have given Russia reason to be\nlieve that the United States and the\ndemocratic European states were mov\ning apart in their sympathies and once\nagain the democratic world would not\npull together in a common cause. And\nwe are not pulling together very well\nyet, are we?\nI am hoping that the whole demo\ncratic world will stand together against\nimperialistic agression. I am also hop\ning that American political leaders will\nhave the vision to see fhat socialism\ncan be part of democracy, in fact al\nready is a part of democracy. Where\nsocialism is weakest in Europe is where\nthere is most fear of communist in\nsurrection. It is my judgment that\nwhen Mr. Stassen or a Montana editor\nmixes up a challenge to fight for de\nmocracy with an indictment of social\nism he Is confusing some patterns of\nmoney-making in the United States\nwith the cause of democracy in the\nworld.

To me it seems the nadir of\ntradition enslavement has been reached\nwhen \"Christian\" people cap slaughter\ntheir fellowmen \u2014 mothers, children,\nbabies and all\u2014-and convince them\nselves the Almighty is Messing the\nbarbarous procedure. The slaughter on\nthe Korean battlefields, our news\ncasters tell us, has been so horrible\nthat even seasoned veterans of the past\nwar are sickened by it. Yet General\nMcArthur is confidently relying on\nGod's blessing.

It doesn't mean to. It\ndoesn't want to. But it is.\nFor the past five months, I have\nbeen watching socialism in opera\ntion. At close hand, I have talked\nwith Britons, Scotsmen and Welsh\nmen of every political faith and\nhave tried objectively to under\nstand wffiat 2\u2019j years of socialism\nhas meant.\nSocialist leaders themselves are\nbecoming frightened at the system\nthey have set in motion.

And Britain must live on\ntrade export,\nSocialism is defeating itself. It\nis trying to do too much in too\nshort a time. And 1948 is the wrong\ntime.\nThis is the time when production\nshould be increased because of world\nshortages. Britain is missing an\nopportunity to get back into the\nworld market with full-scale pro\nduction.\nSocialism\u2014which is based on a\ntheory of overproduction\u2014is fixing\nit so that Britain is working at\nabout half or possibly three-quar\nters speed.\nIncentive and initiative have been\ndulled to the point of lethargy.\nHalf-Hearted Work Spirit\nParticularly In England there is\na half-hearted spirit toward all sorts\nof work. This includes taxi drivers,\nwaiters and shop attendants. It\nincludes busy executives.\nSocialism has imposed so many\nregulations and is keeping taxes so\nhigh that there is a \"what's the\nuse\u201d attitude.\nLondon laundries take from two\nto three weeks to wash your shirts\nand sheets. Cleaners will get cloth\ning back in 10 to 14 days. The\ncompetitive spirit even in such\nservices seems to have perished.\nPeople line up to get into movies,\nrestaurants and buses. There is\nlittle of the zip in London that\ncharacterizes many of America's big\ncities and even those of South\nAmerica.\nSir Stafford Cripps, Chancellor of\nthe Exchequer and the biggest gun\nin today's Socialist lineup, has ap\npealed to the trade unions of\nBritain to suppress new demands\nuntil things get better.\nSir Stafford, Ernie Bevin and\nClement Attlee were the top Social\nists who led the party to victory\nalong with a coalition of the labor\nparty.

But\nwhere the United States runs swing\nshifts to fill in the gaps, the British\nJust close everything and sit down.\nThere is a strong feeling against\nmodernization, too. The British\nlike to do things the wfay they have\nbeen done for the last twro\ncenturies.\nThere is an effort to modernize\ncoal mining. But the British work\nonly one shift a day. American\ncoal operators who work two or\nthree, particularly in Southern\nIllinois, are blocking the shipment\nof new equipment here because the\nsame machinery will produce much\nmore in the United States.\nH ow the Tories Play It\nA favorite drawing room argu\nment is whether Socialism is half\na step toward communism or\nwhether it is Britain's best guaran\ntee against communism.\nSuch discussions usually end with\na partial agreement that British\nsocialism may be headed in the\ndirection of communism as Karl\nMarx conceived it, but that it will\nnever wind up as totalitarian com\nmunism as Joe Stalin has developed\nit. Most freedoms are preserved in\nBritain.\nIt is generally agreed, too, that\nBritish socialism has done enough\nfor the bottom half of the popula\ntion to break the appeal of com\nmunism.\nWould the Labor Party show t\nmajority in an election today?\nThe general opinion is that i1\nwould.

R., Mystery Giant Behind European Crisis\n1\nProduction Statistics\nAdd Little to Data\non Vast Empire\nBy Robert N. Cool\nLast month Soviet authorities told\nthe United Nations that Russian in\ndustrial production was 22 per cent\nhigher in 1947 than It had been dur\ning the preceding year.\nThis information didn\u2019t help very\nmuch, however, because no figures\nfor 1946 had been given. The world\nlearned that Soviet steel production\nwas 9 per cent higher and that farm\noutput had climbed 32 per cent in\nthe year\u2014but from what?\nDead-ends like this help account\nfor the fact that the Union of Soviet\nSocialist Republics\u2014covering one\nsixth of the earth\u2019s surface, and the\nhomeland of Red revolution\u2014is al\nmost as mysterious to the average\noutsider as Southeast Africa,\nSuch ignorance, in a time of\nworld tension, can be dangerous.\nFor the Soviet Union is neither\nsmall nor weak, and its influence is\nfelt throughout all of troubled\nEurope and Asia.\nThe U. S. S. R. Is so large that\nwhen Russians in Siberia are going\nto bed others in Leningrad are\nwaking up for their day's work. It\nis twice as far from the Soviet Pa\ncific coast to the Baltic as from\nNew York to San Francisco; and if\nall the inhabitants of the 16 Soviet\nrepublics were to line up, hand in\nhand, at Moscow, they would stretch\naround the world.\nThough approximately half of the\nRussians are farmers (in contrast\nto three-fourths before the 1917\nrevolution*, the U. S. S. R. now has\nat least 82 cities with more than\n100,000 population. Moscow, the\ncapital and hub, is rapidly ap\nproaching 5.000,000\u2014a limit beyond\nwhich it will not be allowed to grow.\nThese statistics come from a new\ngeopraphy, \"Soviet Land,\u201d recently\npublished in London and distributed\nin the United States by the Mac\nmillan Co. Its author, G. D. B.\nGray, is a well-known British geog\nrapher. w'ho asserts that now \"the\nU. S. S. R. is one large country, a\nnation made up of many peoples.\nwho live in the most varied sur\nroundings and occupy the northern\npart of the greatest continental\nland mass, Eurasia.\u201d\nThis vast region runs from frozen\nArctic wastes, through temperate\nplains and timberlands to semitrop\nical deserts. It includes many of\nthe world's broadest rivers, its\ndeepest lake (more than a mile),\nthe most dismal swamps and the\ngreatest expanse of black fertile\nsoil. Miles of plain are studded with\nprehistoric monuments and have\nnot yet known the plow. Northern\nSiberia has a belt of permanently\nfrozen earth which is slowly re\ntreating northward. It is a relic\nof the last ice age. and the bodies of\nlong-extinct mammoths have been\nfound in it, their flesh so well pre\nserved, say scientists, that it could\nbe eaten\u2014although thousands of\nyears old.\nIn recent years the Soviets have\npushed the settlement of their huge\neastern wilderness. It has been\nfound to be rich in minerals and\nwaterpower. Chief Soviet atomic\nenergy installations are reported to\nbe in the Lake Baikal area of Siberia\nw'here a new industrial region is\ntaking form.\nSlow' in railroad development, the\nRussians long have depended heavily\non water transport. Since 1913 the\nmileage of inland waterways has\nbeen doubled, while road-making,\nrailway building and air routes also\nprogressed.\nThe Baltic-White Sea Canal was\ncompleted in 1933 and was reopened\nin 1946 after having been wrecked\nby the Germans. It is 550 miles long\nand connects Leningrad with the\nArctic Ocean. There, the Soviets\nhave opened a sea route\u2014usable only\nin summer\u2014which Is tapping the\nwilderness by means of great rivers\nthat flow toward the North Pole.\nOne of these rivers, the Yenisei, can\nbe navigated for 3,000 miles. In\nplaces it is 20 miles wide.\nLast January the Soviets an\nnounced that the current five-year\nplan had boosted industrial and J\nagricultural output to prewar levels,\ndespite terrific war damage.\nMost Soviet Industry is building]\nproduction goods, such as praetors, j\ndesigned to strengthen the nation\nin both peace and war. But grain\nand timber are increasingly being\nexported\u2014not only to Eastern Eu\nrope, but also to Britain, France\nand Egypt.\n<Distributed by the Associated Press.)\nOur Chain of Latin American Bases Is Rusting Away\nOnee-Powerful Network of United States Airfields and Naval Stations in the Caribbean and South Atlantic Has\nDeteriorated to the Point of Having Little Value Defensively or Offensively\n(The writer spent 10 months in\nthe West Indies during 1942 and.\n1943 as a Marine Corps sergeant\ncorrespondent when our Carib\nbean defenses were at top\nstrength.

If\nthis happened, America\u2019s only re\n! maining major source of petroleum\nwould be Venezuela and the Dutch\nWest Indies islands of Aruba and\nCuracao.\nOnce a Busy Plane Route\nSecond, in event of a Russian\nattack on Europe and the Middle\nEast, the United States would have\ndesperate need of the World War II\nair route to Africa and the Middle\nEast via Puerto Rico, Trinidad,\nBritish Guiana, Brazil and Ascension\nIsland in the South Atlantic.\nAscension's Wideawake Airbase\nhas been abandoned and the rocky\nisland once more has become a\nvirtually uninhabited dot midway\nbetween the bulges of South Ameri\nca and Africa.\nIn World War II America\u2019s global\nairmen used Ascension as a refueling\npoint on the route to the African\nand European war fronts. Only the\nbirds soar over Ascension today.\nBelem and Natal, in Brazil\u2014also\nvital wartime stepping stones to\nAfrica\u2014still are used by an average\nof one or two American military\nplanes a week. But for actual mili\ni tary purposes both bases are inoper\native. The maintenance crews and\nfacilities are gone, the barracks are\nvacant, the revetments are over\ngrown and the storehouses and fuel\ntanks are empty.\nFurther north on the route lie the\nGuianas, British, French and Dutch.\nDuring World War n, reading from\neast to west, the United States\n| set up strong Army airbases at\nRochambeau Field, near Cayenne,\nin the French colony; at Zandery\nField, near Paramaribo, Dutch\nGuiana, and at Atkinson Field,\nnear Georgetown, British Guiana.\nIn addition, a small naval air\nbase was maintained 70-miles up\nthe Essequibo River at Bartica.\n(British Guiana.\ni j Now only Atkinson Field is op\nerative. The Navy and Marines\nwithdrew from the Essequibo base\n: in 1945 and sold the entire site to\ni British Guiana dealers in lumber.\nZandery Field was evacuated and\n: its facilities turned over to the\nDutch.

Burgess and his sergeant are\ndoing their best to keep the build\nings and runways from succumbing\nto the tropics. But the base is\nslowly deteriorating.\nAbout 200 Army Air Force and\nengineer troops still remain at once\nbustling Atkinson Field. But the\nbase has so few planes that some\nof the pilots stationed there must\nget in their minimum four hours a\nmonth flying time in small training\naircraft. In addition, none of them\nis checked out to fly any thing\nmore up-to-date than a B-25 bomb\ner or a C-54 transport plane.\nHundreds of planes a month used\nAtkinson's fine concrete runways\nduring the war and thousands of\npilots stopped off there while shut\ntling planes back and forth to the\nwar zone. Now two planes a week\nis the average traffic.\nThe married officers and men\nhave their wives and children with\nthem. A large nutriculture or hy\ndroponics garden (soilless culture)\nsupplies not only Atkinson Field,\nbut other Caribbean bases as far\naway as Panama, with fresh veg\netables. Hunting parties go into the\njungle daily in search of tapir, jag\nuar and bush turkey. But, left to\nitself, the base could not defend\nitself today against, say, the army\nof the Dominican Republic.\nTrinidad, lying of! the coast of\nVenezuela and to the east of Aruba\nand Curacao, once contained no less\nthan three land plane bases, a large\nnaval operating base, the Navy sea\nplane base at Chagaramas and\nstrong garrison forces of Marines\nand soldiers.\nAll that remain today are Waller\nField\u2014an Army airbase with few\npersonnel and fewer planes\u2014and\nthe Chagaramas Naval Station, op\nerating like everything else in the\nCaribbean\u2014on a shoestring. The\nTrinidad rain forest has reclaimed\nvast areas once occupied by bar\nracks and plane parkings and the\nfew hundred Americans remaining\nare hamstrung by their own lack of\nnumbers and materiel.\nTrinidad's capital Port-of-Spain,\na busy seaport, no longer harbors\nunits of the American Fleet as it.\ndid during the war.

Italy\nMany Italians Swung Over to Communist Side\nfor Their Own Safety After the Token\nAllied Force Was Withdrawn\nBy Constantine Brown '\nThe future of Italy has hung In the balance ever since the peace\ntreaty was ratified last year, and particularly since American and British\ntoken forces were withdrawn December 1*. 1947.\nThe election which is being held today and tomorrow from the Alps\nto the Mediterranean is regarded with deep concern by the western\npowers and with hopefulness by Russia and her satellites.\nBoth groups of powers are fiilly aware of Italy\u2019s strategic importance\nand are convinced that communism*- \u2014 ~~ ~ ~ ~\nin Western Europe will recede or\nprogress in accordance with events\nin Italy. They all agree that the\n; new republic is of vital importance\nfrom a political and military point,\nof view.\ni Get Orders From Moscow\nWhile the prospects of. a limited\n! victory for the non-Communist\nparties at the polls have increased\nin the last few weeks, the possibility\nof a military coup d'etat on the part\nof the Communists headed by Pal\nin iro Togliatti is not being dis\n| counted, either in Washington or\n| the capitals of Western European\nnations.\nLike other Communist leaders all\nover the world, the Italian Red\nchiefs take their orders direct from\nMoscow. The Politburo is not im\nprovising its policies; they were\nestablish a long time ago.\nIn the case of Italy Russian policy\nwas planned as long ago as 1944,\nwhen Moscow made an agreement\nwith Premier Marshal Pietro Bado\nglio to permit the return to his\nhomeland of Togliatti, w'ho under\nthe name of Ercole Ercoll had been\na- leading member of the Third\nInternationale in Moscow.\nAfter many consultations with\nMoscow the Communist leaders\ndecided to place Italy behind the\niron curtain, either by what they\nclll the democratic process\u2014\n\"through government to power''\u2014or\nby force. They would prefer the\nformer, but if they fail all observers\nagree the Communists will use force.\nIt is now an established fact that\nif they get 35 to 40 per cent of the\ntotal vote, the president of the\nnewly elected National Assembly\nwill designate the future premier of\nthe country. The Communists and\ntheir associates will form a strong\nminority in the chamber and this\nmay compel the inclusion of three\nor possibly four ranking Commu\nnists in the cabinet.\nSeparatist Action Feared\nObservers believe that once Togli\natti and some of his henchmen are\n| firmly in the government they will\noperate in the same manner as the\n] Czech Prime Minister, Klement\ni Gottwald. Before the end of the\n| year Italy would become a puppet\n| state by means of a coup similar\nto that perpetrated in Prague.\nIf the Italian voters should re\nturn less than 35 per cent Com\nmunists in the new Assembly, and\nIf as a consequence a non-Com\nmunist government is formed, there\nis a strong probability that the\n\u201cPartisan Army\u201d\u2014some 150,000\nstrong and well-equipped with\narms and ammunition from Yugo\nslavia and Russia\u2014will be used to\ncreate a separatist movement in\nNorthern Italy between the River\nPo and the Alps.\nThe main strength of the Com\nmunists is in the rich industrial\nand agricultural area in that ter\nritory, w\u2019hich is of vital Importance\nto the plans of the U. S. S. R. for the\ndomination of Europe. Northern\nItaly lies between Yugoslavia and\nFrance.\nA Communist republic separated\nfrom Rome could be strongly sup\nported by its immediate neighbor,\nYugoslavia, and would be a Jumping\nofT point for Communist penetra\ntion and infiltration into France.\nFurthermore, since 80 per cent of\nItaly's wealth is centered in the\nnorth, Southern Italy would die on\nthe vine, in spite of American sup\nport. In all likelihood it would\neventually joint Northern Italy.\nAgainst these two long-range plans\nthe United States has improvised a\npolicy based principally on economic\nand financial support for the pres\nent government and on the threat\nto cut it off if the Italian people,\ndespite pressing appeals from Amer\nica, decide to cast a large vote for\nCommunist candidates.\nU. S. Slow to Act\nWhile Russia, directly and through\nthe Cominform, was helping Togll\natti to impress the voters by pro\nviding him with hard cash and the\nnecessary arms and ammunition to\nequip his shock troops, we have only\nrecently begun to give perfunctory\nhelp in the reorganization of the\nItalian Army, which is intrusted\nwith the task of preventing a Com\nmunist coup.\nWhile the Communists have been\nactive in organizing their private\narmy since 1945. we began to send\narms and ammunition to the regu\nlar military and police force of the\nItalian government only three\nmonths ago.\nThe American Government was\n! convinced after the end of the war\nthat dollars could purchase peace.\nOur entire diplomatic strategy was\nbased on the belief that Russia\nwanted to reorganize her economy\nand that the other nations, which\nhad suffered so much in the last\nwar, could not fail to accept our\neconomic and financial support. We\nfailed to realize until recently that\nthe U. S. S. R. was bent on dom\nination and would not hesitate to\nthrow her whole military power into\nthe drive to expand as rapidly as\npossible.\nNot only in Russia but in all the\nother countries which fell behind\nthe iron curtain\u2014with our direct\nor indirect help\u2014bullets are more\nimportant than butter.\nThe countries on the fringe of\nthe iron curtain are afraid of\nSoviet armed power. What good is\nit, they ask, to rebijpd homes, in\ndustries and the entire economic\nfabric when there is no visible\nmilitary power anywhere in the west\nto protect them against the ruth\nlessness of the Soviet armies.\nWe have failed to realize that\npeople like the Italians, who were\ninvaded once before in World War\nI and twice during World War II,\nare more interested in preventing\nanother invasion by the Asiatics\nthan in economic reconstruction.\nAnd if they cap avert such a ca\nlamity by accepting Communist\ndomination, they prefer it to the\nrisks of a civil war, which would\nbe followed by a full-fledged inva\nsion from Yugoslavia.\nSo long as there were some\nAmerican and British troops in\nItaly prior to December 15 tha\nmorale of the Italian people re\ntSee ITALY'S FUTURE, Page C-2T.\nAnti-Red Drive\nNear in Sweden\nLabor Party Plans to\nWrest Gains From\nCommunists\nBy Teddy Rosenthal\nSTOCKHOLM.\u2014How can the\nCommunists be beaten, their tactic*\nexposed and their threat reduced to\nnaught? Sweden\u2019s Social Demo\ncratic Labor Party think* it has\nthe answer.\nThe situation in Sweden, where\nthe Communist Party never once\nhas been forbidden during the 30\nyears of its existence, may well be\nconsidered typical for Western\nEurope.\nSweden\u2019s Communist Party, after\na decided slump in 1940, made its\nstrongest stride forward in the\nparliamentary elections in 1944.\nThey received 318,000 of 3,063,000\nvotes and increased their deputies\nfrom 3 to 15 in the 230-member\nlower house. They also placed two\ndeputies in the 150-member upper\nhouse.\nTime to W in Back WWkers\nThis striking gain runs parallel\nto the ups and downs of Russia's\ninternational good will. In 1940\nafter her attack on Finland, Russia\nwas very unpopular in Sweden. It\nwas openly declared in Parliament\nthat the Communist Party was \"not\nin the ordinary sense a political\nparty, but a part of an international\norganization under Russian con\ntrol.\u201d\nIn 1944, Russia \u2019had gained great\ngood will because of her fight\nagainst Nazi Germany.\nThere was another reason for the\nCommunist gains in the 1944 elec\ntions: The Social Democratic Party\nhad formed a national coalition\ngovernment with all parties except\nthe Communists. Workers com\nplaining over the freezing of wages\nand wartime scarcities found no way\nof voicing their dissatisfaction\nexcept by voting with the Com\nmunists.\nNow, Social Democrat* say, is the\ntime to win back these workers.\nThis fight against the Communist*\nis being concentrated into a \u2018\u2018spring\ncampaign.\u201d\nThe campaign is conducted with\npublic debates, Intended to expos#\nCommunist tactics, and the avowed\nintention of Sweden's Communist*\nto reach the same goal a* in\nCzechoslovakia.\nTrained to Bore From Within\nPaul Bjoerk, \"labor secretary\u201d\nof the Social Democratic Labor Party\nand central organizer of the spring\ncampaign, said the unmasking of\nthe Communists should start at tha\nvery place where they gain their\n| first foothold\u2014in the labor unions.\n\"No party is as well organized\nand so strongly disciplined and\ntrained for infiltration activities as\nthe Communists,\u201d Bjoerk said.\nBesides special agents in most\nworkshops, the Communists have a\nmobile cadre of workers, able to\nmove from one shop to another in\nadvance of important political or\nunion elections. The development\nof such \"task forces\u2019 has been fa\ncilitated by the lack of skilled\nlabor, especially in the metal in\ndustries.\nOutside the labor movement.\nCommunists are trying to infiltrate\nin the co-operative societies, the\nWorkers\u2019 Educational League, the\nTenants' Savings and Building As\nsociation and other organizations.\nThe time of Communist coups in\nlabor unions is gone, Bjoerk said.\nThe Social Democrats now are wise\nto their tactics and are beating the\nCommunists by their own methods.\nBut anti-Communlst propaganda\nis carried outside local union in\nterests. It takes up international\neconomic problems and spreads\ninformation on foreign political\nevents.\nThe events in Czechoslovakia\nhave had a great impact on labor\u2019s\nstand against communism in\nSweden. In nearly all unions\nholding elections after the Com\nmunist coup in Czechoslovakia, the\nCommunists have been removed\nfrom office.\nSeveral local unions have pub\nlished resolutions urging Com\nmunist leaders to dissolve their\nparty. \u201cOnly one labor party is\nneeded.\u201d they say.\n(DittribuMd br the So*Prtmt"}, {"title": "proletarec.", "city": ["Chicago"], "date": "19450530", "raw_text": "A Yugoslav Weekly Devoted to the\nInterest of the Workers\n\u2022\nOFFICIAL ORGAN OF\nJ.

Meantime Yugoslavia should have the most\nconvincing assurance that her case of sovereignty over the city will\nreceive fullest American and British consideration in the peace settle\nments.\nIt isn\u2019t a case of assuring Yugoslavia that she wins American or\nBritish backing for permanent retention; it is a case of assuring her\nthat the \u201cfix\u201d is not in for Italy. It is also to be hoped that Field Mar\nshal Sir Harold \u2022 Alexander will be instructed to avoid in future in\nflammatory language such,as he used against Marshal Tito in a political\nattack camouflaged as an order of the day to Allied troops. After\nYugoslavia\u2019s enormous sacrifice and heroic contribution for victory,\nto compare her leader with Hitler and Mussolini within two weeks\nafter V-E Day passes understanding.\nThe problem of Trieste demands Allied firmness, diplomacy and\njustice.

The king' of the Bel\ngians has also married a commoner and may have to give up his throne\nurn doing so. Windsor wasn\u2019t the first man of royal blood or even th\nfirst king to insist on marrying the girl of his choice, but he may have\npopularized the idea. If so, he deserves a vote of thanks.\nThe king business is an anachronism that ought to be abolished.\nThese recent examples of the nonsense that governs the choice of a\nroyal mate should help speed the institution into oblivion. The notion\nthat royal blood is superior to ordinary blood and must not be mingled\nwith it was firmly believed by pretty nearly everybody for hundreds\nof years but isn\u2019t believed by anybody today. Accordingly, when a\ngreat to-do is made of the marriage of a king to a commoner, the fuss\nserves to focus attention on the absurdity of the institution, and by\ndoing so many hasten its disappearance,\nKings are bad for a country for a number of reasons, but chiefly\nbecause they make for false standards of thought and behavior. A\nking\u2019s training tends to make him self-important, vain, and wasteful,\nand the exaltation of such a man tends to corrupt his nation. As head\nof a social system, a king wield\u2019s a powerful influence even in a con\nstitutional regime; he commonly uses his social leadership to preserve\nan aristocratic caste system that a modern country cannot afford to\nmaintain.

That would be a\nlong step toward Socialism.\nSir Stafford Cripps says: \"It\u2019s\ntime to displace the old conception\nwhich still lingers on that proper\nty, money and material possessions\nare more important than human\nlife and happiness.\u201d Winston\nChurchill will probably brand that\na \"pious platitude,\u201d but what sub\nstitute will he offer.\u2014Labor.\n\"KILLED\" AGAIN\nSocialism is being \u201ckilled\u201d again. This time it is being done to\ndeath by The Reader\u2019s Digest, aided and abetted by Book-of-thc-Month\nClub, Inc. And it is being done in six languages, no less: English, Span\nish, Portuguese, Swedish, Arabic and Chinese\u2014not to mention Braille\nand Talking-Record editions of the Digest.\nThe killing is being done at present through world-wide circula\ntion, by the above-mentioned organizations, of a condensation of a book\ncalled The Road to Serfdom,\u201d by Frederick A. Hayek, an Austrian,\nnow at the University of London.\nNow the road to serfdom is what, according to our professor? You\nmay have guessed it already: it is socialism\u2014and economic planning.\n11 was German and Italian socialists who \u201ccreated the prototype of the\ntotalitarian type.\u201d \u201cIn Germany socialism had killed liberalism by the\ntime Hitler came to power,\u201d says the professor, adding that \u201cto many\nwho have watched the transition from socialism to fascism at close\nquarters Ihe connection between the two systems has become increas\ningly obvious.\nSince fascism, both German and Italian brands, is now universally\ncondemned, this seems to be a sly trick to \u201cconnect socialism with it,\nin the hope that it will share in the condemnation. But the whole world\nknows by this time that both Hitler and Mussolini were put into power\nby industrialists and financiers, both enemies of the socialist and trades\nunion movement. Prominent socialists and labor leaders were the first\nlo fill the concentration camps, and to be brutally killed and tortured.\nSocialists in this and other countries have been the most determined,\nunremitting enemies of fascism during the past quarter of a century;\nhut to try to connect the \u201csystem\u201d advocated by socialists with that of\nthe fascists isn\u2019t just plain stupidity.\nThe Austrian professor says in his book: \u201cIt is not difficult to de\nprive the great majority of independent thought.\u201d\nAnother Austrian, named Hitler, said that people will believe any\nlie if it\u2019s big enough and repeated often enough. In this respect the two\nAustrians' have something in common; and the organizations circulat\ning his stuff seem to think also that \u201cindependent thought\u201d can be in\nfluenced under sufficient pressure. Hence the \u201cconnection\u201d between\nthe two systems which is so \u201cobvious\u201d to the professor, and no doubt\nto the R. D.\nIn addition to killing off socialism, the book attempts to do the\nI same thing with all kinds of economic planning\u2014all but one. We must\n. plan so that competition must be left to function unobstructed.\u201d in\ni order to preserve \u201cindividual freedom.\u201d Anything else means serfdom,\n\u2022and free enterprise \u201cunobstructed competition\u201d \u2014is the road to\nsalvation.\nThis view explains the great popularity of the book among cap\nitalistic concerns, especially the larger ones. I\u2019t like cola on a hot day;\n! gives them a lift. And they need it right now as news and reports\n; from Europe indicate that the chief struggle for power over there is\nbetween socialism and communism, with capitalism a poor third.\nAnd this seems to indicate that socialism isn\u2019t dead after all, in\nspite of Hayek\u2019s best endeavors. Bismarck and his anti-socialist laws\nof three-quarters of a century ago failed to kill socialism in Germany;\nthe murderous brutality and concentration camps of Hitler and Musso\n| lini failed to kill it; and The Readers Digest, Book-of-the-Month Club,\nInc., and the corporations circulating Hayek s misleading attack will\nlikewise fail.\nAn,d. they\u2019ll fail to kill economic planning, too, for the simple\nreason that without such future planning their profit system would\nsoon collapse about them. But the kind of planning capitalists and their\nsupporters will dp Will be for the protection of profits, not for peace\nand plenty and ffepdbm for their exploited workers. For the latter,\ndemocratic socialism as advocated by the Socialist party, is the roacl\nto economic freedom and abundance. \u2014Reading Labor Advocate.\nTHE QUESTION OF SPAIN\nOne question which the Western AlJjps earnestly hoped to brush off\nbut forced itself into the discussion at San Francisco is the\nquesfipf? Spain. The collapse of Nazi power has left to Franco the\nuneasy honor of being the last important focus of fascism on the\nEuropean continent. He has m,ef the situation by trying to scramble\nover to the democratic side, but he has discovered, like his confreres\nin Argentina, that every gesture in the direction of liberty necessitates\nmore severe measures of repression if his regime is not to be over\nthrown. Last February he shot without trial sixteen political prisoners\nin reprisal for the killing of two minor Falangist officials during an\nattack on a Falagist party headquarters in a workers\u2019 district in\nMadrid. Just recently eight others were sentenced to die for complicity\nin this attack: seven of them were executed. Republicans insist that the\nincident was a frame-up to provide a plausible excuse for the execu\ntions. But the fact remains that political arrests and killings have\nmarkedly increased since Franco began issuing his series of amnesty\nannouncements. The lot of the dictator turned democrat is not merely\nhard, it is hopeless.\u2014The Nation.\nPRO AND CON ON JOHN L. LEWIS\nThe other day John L. Lewis!\ngave his opinion about the Amcr\nican Labor Movement in an article\n! published by Collier\u2019s Weekly. We\nj want to give our viewpoint on\nLewis\u2019 statements and, since hard\nly anybody agrees entirely with\nLewis, it can scarcely be expected\nthat we will.\nWhat Lewis says is that there\nis no Labor Movement in America.\nHe says that the unions of today\narc nothing more than company\nunions under the domination of\npoliticians. He says that the big i\nunions have agreed to play the\ngame according to rules laid down\ni by political leaders without secur\n! ing a bill of rights for themselves.\nAnd in all this we believe that\nLewis is justified by the behavior\nof most big union leaders since the\nstart of the war in particular and .\nsince the advent of the first Roose\nvelt administration in general.\nHowever, we find ourselves in\nconflict with Lewis when we con\nsider his general attitude toward\npolitical action. If we understand\nhim correctly, Lewis does not\nthink that politics is important. All\nthat he thinks necessary is that\nunions should fight for what their\nmembers want without regard for\nthe wishes of political leaders in\nand out of public office.\nIf that is what he means we are\nafraid that the success of organiz\ned labor would not bring social\njustice and democracy; not, at\nleast, with society organized as it\nis today. For one thing, there are\ntoo many people who are out of\nEDUCATION\nORGANIZATION\nCO-OPERATIVE\nCOMMONWEALTH\norganized labor groups and for\nwhom a union leader cannot ne\ngotiate.\nPerhaps those millions of work\ners who arc organized could gain\nadvantage for themselves by\nfollowing the Lewis line. But the\nehances that the gains of the\norganized section of the working\nclass would be entirely at the ex\npense of the millions of unorganiz\ned are strong enough to be dis\nquieting.\nWe hold out for the political ap\nproach to the solution of social\nproblems because everybody con\nceivably be represented in politics.\nBy the use of the ballot all people\ncould find a common denominator.\nMoreover, being Socialists, our\nI objective is not to find some means\n.of dealing satisfactorily with priv\ni ate owners of industry, but to so\nj cialize the economy of the nation\nand end private profit altogether.\nThat, we believe, can be done best\nby organized use of the imple\nments of political democracy. In\nthe end, what we want is not that\nworkers should deal with owners,\nbut that all able adults should be\nworkers and that none but work\ners should share in the wealth\nproduced by human toil.\u2014Reading\n!

He\none man tossing a rubber ball up\nto a second story window where\non tbe sidewalk took several bets\nfrom passers-by, stuffed the slips\n* nto a slit In the rubber ball and\n| tossed it to the man with the net.\nBoth were arrested as bookmak\ners. Magistrate John P. X. Master\nson observed: \"This seems to dis\nprove the district attorney's the\nory that bookies play ball with the\ncops. They play ball among them\nselves,\"\nsaw\na second man caught It in a net.\nWatching revealed that thc\nman\nwho oppose the Administration on other is\nsues are also in general agreement on this\u2014\nthough they are far from convinced that the\nAdministration has the'kind of leadership\nthat is needed in a time of world crisis, or\nthat its past and present foreign policy\nmakes cohesive sense. In any event, the\npolls indicate that there is small chance of\nAmerican people being lulled into com\nplaceny by Soviet peace overtures, great as\ndesire f or a rea j an( J h ones t peace is.\nOne of the great questions is why the\nRussians do not move in Europe now, while\nthe vast Army which Eisenhower is to com-i\nmand exists only in the blueprints. By 1953,\naccording to plan, Eisenhower will have 60\nfinely trained and equipped divisions\u2014\nenough, in his judgment to hold the Russian\nhordes. Why should Russia wait\u2014if she\nmeans war\u2014until a time when victory in\nEurope would be incredibly costly and might\nbe impossible?\nOne answer, of course, is our A-bomb\nstockpile, which all believe is many times\nthe size of the Soviet's. Another answer\u2014\nnot nearly so often mentioned\u2014is that Rus\nsia may not be nearly so strong as many in\nthe West believe. There is great unrest in\nthe satellite states, and war might bring\nthis* into open revolution. Her industrial\npotential is growing, but it may be weaker\nthan we estimate. If the Kremlin leaders\nfeel\u2014and there is evidence that they do\u2014\nthat war would destroy them and their sys\ntem, this is as great an asset as the West\npossesses.\nHEIGHT OF IMPROPRIETY\nA writer who's business is to keep in\ntouch with national affairs has said, \"Today\nin Washington circles that formerly advo\ncated Compulsory Health Insurance, it i\nconsidered the height of impropriety even\nto mention it.'' What has caused this* rather\nremarkable about-face in political circles!\nthat keep their ears to the ground and their\nIS\neyes on the voter? The answer is obvious.\nThe American people, taken as a whole, want\nno part of socialized medicine, political med\nicine, or any kind of medicine that would be\nunder government domination. There is pow\nerful evidence to support that statement,\nMore than 11,000 organizations\u2014including\nleading national groups which represent ag\nriculture, labor, industry, the veterans, _:X\nversity women, and so on\u2014have taken a\nsolid stand against Compulsory Health In\nsurance.

Mr.\nAttlee still heads the Labor\nGovernment of Great Britain\nbut is plagued with a duodenal\nulcer which has already hospi\ntalized him.. This ulcer could\nconceivably force him to follow\nhis former right hand man. Sir\nStafford Cripps. into retirement.\nSir Stafford was in several w r ays\nthe brightest luminary in the\nBritish Labor movement; an\neminent lawyer, and an intellectual of the first mag\nnitude. A few' months back he had to mire as\nChancellor of thc Exchequer for reasons of health.\nHe suffers from colitis. Early this year the third\nn\\an in the Labor Government. Ernest Bevin, suf\nfered an illness that forced him to retire as For\neign Secretary. Shortly thereafter he died at the\nage of 70.\nI am not exulting over casua'ues among top\nranking British Socialists. I consider Attlee. Cripps\nand Bevin men of the highest integrity and the\nnoblest intentions. Were they rogues paying lip\nservice to Socialism, in order to further personal\nambition, all three might now be in good health,\nriding high on the road to more power! At least,\nthis is what I learn here in New York.\n\\\n'\nj\n\u25a0\n%\nROGER W. BABSON\nSOCIALISM A (KI EL HOAX\nTo my way of thinking, Socialism as set up\ntoday constitutes a cruel hoax. Socialists discover\nthat many evils can be traced back to individual\nprivate greed. This is true. But the Socialists con\nclude, all too quickly, that private greed or private\nenterprise, should be outlawed. They then national\nize the big private enterprises and turn them over\nto the government. They \"sink the ship to rid it\nof rats.\" But the hoax is that the coming of Social\nism to power brings frustration, stagnation, and\nfinally the need for \"austerity.\" Only individual\nincentive provides the spark and fuel of human\nendeavor.\nWhen honest SociaMsts. like the big three of\nreceive in addition a or.e-week va-i\ncation trip to Arizona during De\neetnbcr where they will be the\n\u00c7. ue , 8 . ts of the Goodyear Tire and\nRubber Company, sponsor of these\nsoil conservation awards to dram- !\na,iz<> the preservation of America's\nv >tal topsoil.\nArkansas.

He did not permit the fallacies\nof Socialism to ruin his health! He switched to\npersonal autocracy an i then went back to antiquity\nto find an ethical sotnding name for it. calling it\n\"Fascism.\" Hitler pail lip service to Socialism by\ncalling his autocracy ''National Socialism.\"\nWHO WILL He \"BIG BROTHER\"?\nBritain's fourth Solcialist leader, Aneurin Bevan,\nnot to be confused with the late Ernest Bevin, has\nthe demagogue's appeal, the opportunism and the\nviolent demeanor. This fits him to become the\nEnglish counterpart of Mussolini or Hitler. Aneurin\nBevan recently deserted Attlee for motives which\nsome observers believe were to increase his own\npower.\nStraw polls and local elections foreshadow the\nfall of the Attlee government. I wonder whether\nAttlee's successor will be able to proceed with\nthe present governmental machinery. Or will revo\nlution and dictatorship be the outcome of Britain's\nexperiment with Socialism? As for- me, give me a\ncountry with a democratic capitalistic Government\nlike our own, that seeks workable compromise\nbetween collective needs and individual incentive.\nj\n... . . .\nsh, p winners were boys who were I\ncompeting in the competition for\nthe sixth time.

The moral\nside of man. too, is deeply in\nvolved in man's economics, for\nethics comes into play in the\nvery real way in which the\nmoral restraints act as gover\nnors on consuming greed and\nthirst for power. Economics,\nthen, is such a dominant thread\nin ail of man's earthly activities\nthat it most assuredly should be\ntaught in the public schools.\nThe teaching of economics has\nbeen sadly neglected in the\nAmerican 60hool system. The\nOpinion Research Corporation in\n1%(> in-a poll of high school sen\niors found:\nEighty-two per cent believ\ned ritOnopolies are the rule\nin America\u2019s major indus\ntries.\nSixty-one per cent think\nthe profit system is not es\nsential to the survival of our\nway of life.\nSixty-one per cent don't\nunderstand that productivity\nis the key to rising living\nstandards.\nSixty per cent favor strong\ngovernment action to guar\nantee' jobs.\nTo say that these statistics\nrepresent a basic misconception\not the characteristics of our en\nterprise system is to express it\nmildly.\nWhen we realize that nation\nally 90 per cent of our children\nfinish the eighth grade, and only\n6f> per cent complete four years\nof high school i the retention\nrate* in Richmond for Che year\n190S-61 through four > ears of\nhigh school was 49 per cent i, we\ncan see that unless economics is\ntaught in the public school sys\ntem. economic illiteracy is inevi\ntable. Lest we be downhearted\nin Richmond, it must be said\nthat nationally 43 per cent of the\nhigh school graduates go on to\na senior or junior college, where\nas in our city this figure was\n54.8 per cent, a respectable dif\nferential indeed in our favor.\nWith the government interven\ning today in so many facets of\neconomic activity the need for\neconomic literacy in our exer\ncise of the voting franchise is\nimperative.\n\u2022The retention rate is af\nfected by pupils who move from\nthe city or transfer to private\nschools as well as by drop-outs.\nThe Russian challenge\u2014much\ndiscussed today, and properly\nso\u2014is to be dreaded not only in\nits military aspects but equally,\nand perhaps more so, in its eco\nnomic implications. The emer\ngence of Russia as a great pow\ner is one of those counterpoises\nin history which I accept With\nout attempting to be a Polly\nanna, I have often thought that\nin the absence of some great\nand challenging power, America,\nfor all its humanity and for all\nthe generosity of its national\nspirit, could well be too much\nthe cock of the walk, lacking a\nchallenge worthy of its steel.\nYou will note that I said \u201cwor\nthy of its steel.\" I do believe\nthe Russian challenge militarily,\nideologically and economically is\na powerful challenge. Khrush\nchev has said that he will\n\u201cbury\u201d us. I doubt the tnith of\nthis statement if our moral fiber\nand our national will stays\nstrong. I believe deeply in the\nproductivity of free men, but in\norder that this productivity may\nbe exercised, we have to be ever\non guard for our freedoms \u2014 to\nrepeat, the greatest blessing on\nthis earth.\nNot many sections of America\nhave had enacted so close to\nthem as have we in Richmond\nthe great drama of Communist\neconomics. The colonists at\nJamestown tried and abandoned\none of its central tenets after\nmanifest failure. Following a\nbrief trial the plan of \"To each\naccording to Iris need and from\neach according to his ability\"\nwas abolished in 1617. From\nthen on as the tiny colony be\ngan to show marked progress,\nthe rule was that everyone had\nto depend on his own labor and\nthe freely given compassion of\nhis neighbor in times of adver\nsity. When the colonists first\nstarted contributing to a com-1\nmon storehouse, they observed\nthat fewer and fewer contribut\ned and more and more remained\nidle and drew on the common\nstore. They quickly found that\neach man had a great need to\nreceive but few evidenced much\ninterest in exercising their abili\nty to give! Yes, man is inher\nently lazy and his nature re\nquires the compulsion of need\nunder any economic system. And\nour colonists at Jamestown,\nlacking either the will or the\nmeans to kill the noncontribu\ntors (as modern Communists\ndo), or the desire to send these\nnonoontributors out into Indian\ncountry (Siberia of 1960\u2019s) simp\nly changed to another and bet\nter system.\nTo draw on Malory again, it\nis my own view that the second\ngreat event of 1776 was the pub\n! lication of Adam Smith's Wealth\nof Nations. This book was the\nprincipal cause in the crumbling\nof mercantilism which had\ngrown to its full development in\nthe seventeenth century. The\nhard core of mercantilism was\nj the laying of the hand of all\n! powerful government over all\nI the economic life of England.\nPrices were stabilized; wages\nand hours of labor fixed: pio\nI duction regulated: and foreign\ntrade, both exports and imports,\ncompletely dominated bv the\nstate. The policies of mercantil\nism were devoted to the aggran\ndizement of the state which\nwas conceived, in terms of\nMachiavellian political thought,\nto be without ideals. Adam\nSmith was intent on exploding\nwhat he considered erroneous\napd harmful ideas. Let me\npause here to say that Smith\nwas an historian before he was\nan economist. He was steeped\nin the knowledge of history, and\nhe understood what Santayana\n, meant when he said that those\nwho do not learn from the past\nare condemned to relive it. My\nown theory is that the Wealth of\nNations and its doctrines of\nlaissez-faire would have had a\nfuller life in its true sense had\nmankind in practice coupled it\nwith Smith's Theory of Moral\nSentiments. Smith never intend\ned that economic actions were to\nbe in a vacuum. He realized\nthe need for moral restraint. He\nunderstood human nature and\nthat unless greed and avarice\nwere self - restrained, then\nlaissez-faire would be spoiled of\nitc maximum fruition.\nAnd now we come to the state\nment of a prominent man in\n1947, 171 years later, and I\n> quote;\n\u201cNeither communism with its\ndespotism, nor capitalism with'\nits instability, nor fascism with j\nits combination of the two. pro-1\nride attractive solutions to the I\nproblem of how to live with ;\nmodern industry in the modem 1\nstate. Is there another possi- j\nbility? Has noncommunist, lib-!\nertarian socialism a future? Ab\nstracting the question for a mo\nment from current political ac\ntivities one must answer that\nthere is no inherent reason why\ndemocratic socialism should not\nbe possible.\n\u2018\u2018If socialism \u25a0 i.e.. the owner\nship by the state of all signifi\ncant means of production' is to\npreserve democracy, it must be\nbrought about step by step in a\nway which will not disrupt the\nfabric of custom, law, and mu\ntual confidence upon which per\nsonal rights depend. That is, the\ntransition must be peicemeal: it\nmust be parliamentary; it must\nrespect civil liberties and due\nprocess of law . .\nThe author of this article is\nArthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., writ\ning in the Partisan Review in\n1947 and now one of the Presi\ndent's key advisers. This is the\nsort of insidious, unhinged think\ning which frightens me and\ngives me a feeling of urgency.\nLet me raise just, three questions\nout of many which might be\npromulgated from this quotation.\nMr. Schlesinger refc r s to\n\u201ccapitalism wnth its instability\"\nas not providing an attractive\nsolution to the problem of how\nto live with modem industry in\nthe modern state. Is mortal man\nso pusillanimous, is tranquil ex\nistence so dear that instability\nis a state of affairs most to be\nfeared? Is not lost freedom a\ngreater fear? Is there anything\nin the history of British mercan\ntilism or French democratic so\ncialism as practiced by Blum\nin the 1930's or the socialism\nwhich preceded the rise of Hit\nler which would cause us to feel\nthat it is an economic way of\nlife and a political way of life\nwhich are more attractive than\nthe American way? Of course,\nin the modern state a deep-cut\nting depression of the type wit\nnessed in 1929-1932 has come to\nbe thougnt unbearable, out 1929\n1932 is not the hallmark of the\nenterprise system. Look at this\nnation in all its power today and\nthink of this nation in 1913,\nmuch less in 1776. Then you will\nget the truly great perspective\nof our history under an econo\nmy where the market price, as\nmanifested by the needs of the\npeople in the market place, de\ntermines what is to be produced\nas contrasted with decisions by\nall pervading government on\nwhat is to be produced!\nSecondly, the author says\n\", . . there is no inherent reason\nwhy democratic socialism should\nnot be possible\u201d \u2014 no reason\nexcept that democratic socialism\nis an impossible anomaly. No\nreason except that the very con\ncept of democratic socialism,\nmuch less its practice, is blind\nto ingrained traits of human na\nture. Man is acquisitive. The de\nsire to own property is part and\nparcel of his being. Why does\nMr. Schlesinger feel that a\ndemocratic socialism as he en\nvisions it would obliterate hu\nman greed and the seeking of\npower? Would not the chastise\nment of those who defaulted in\ntheir obligations to the public\nweal in a massive bureaucracy\nof democratic socialism never\nbe brought to light but remain\nhidden forever in the shell and\npea game? Would not the free- j\ndom of the press be inevitably\nthreatened, and does not so\nmuch of our freedom depend\nupon freedom of the press?\nI grant you it is possible to\ntry Mr. Schlesinger\u2019s democratic\nsocialism if any party in pdwer\ncan seize the means of produc\ntion. But there aie many inher\nent reasons why even if it were\npossible, the implied question,\n\"Is it preferable to the enter\nprise system7' should be \u2022an\nswered in a resounding nega\ntive. What governmental eco\nnomic function do you know\nthat is performed today that is\nnot an infringement of freedom\nand that is performed with dis\npatch and efficiency? The Brit\nish, after their government had\nseized the ownership of the steel\nmills in the l\u2018\u00bb40s. returned\nthem to private ownership and\nprivate management because\nthis sinew of national power was\nhopelessly throttled in ineffici\nency in the government bu\nreaucracy.\nWhat freedom would we have\nif the government owned all the\nmeans of production and told\nme I could not be a banker even\nthough I am in the banking\nbusiness because I love it?\nWhat reason would you have to\nthink that the government would\nnot tell you you could not be a\nschool principal but must wwk\nin an automobile factory?\nThirdly, the author says.\n. it I the transitioni must be\nparliamentary; it must respect\ncivil liberties and due process\nof law . . Ah. how the form\ncan be made to seem like the\nsubstance! Did the Pounding\nFathers prepare the three\nbranches of the government for\npurely capricious reasons? Of\ncourse not. They knew it would\nbe cumbersome, but they trust\ned no man and no group of men\nwith the sum total of power\nincluding economic power\u2014over\nthem. Where in history can we\nfind that socialism has in two\nand a half centuries brought a\nnation to such power as America\nhas today and its total people\nto the benefits the American to\nday enjoys? And I submit that\nsocialism in which the state is\nthe total economic power is an\ninfringement on human liberties\nnot to be countenanced by free\nand literate men.\nThs intellectual bombardment\nis subtle in its appeal to both\nthe humane trait' of the big\nheart, i.e., we want to see no\nhuman suffer in a business de\npression, and the more obvious\ntrait of greed for greater power,\ni.e., ever bigger government.\nThis thinking of Mr. Sehlesin\nger\u2019s might be termed orbital\nthinking. I happily join in the\nthirst for knowledge of the uni\nverse, the exploration of the\nphysical sciences, and the specu\nlation of man in his philosophi\ncal musings. But where we are\ndealing with the history of man\nkind, where we are dealing with\ningrained human traits, I take\nmy stand on the side of rooted\nthinking which appreciates that\nthe* tiee, of course, does grow\nand changes as it thrusts itself\ninto the sun of time. I appreci\nate that the limbs can be cut\noff and the top of the tree can\nbe shaped and that man does\nhave a capacity to control and\nform his institutions, but man is\nindeed small In the womb of his\ntory, and he is always rooted in\nhis nature and his past.\nYou have rightly concluded\nthat I feel this insidious line of\nthought can be combated only\nthrough education in economics\nand that economics is the out\ngrowth of history and human\nnature: that economics has no\nmeaning that will hold true un\nless always related to the his\ntory of man\u2019s efforts \u2014 his suc\ncesses and his failures \u2014 and\nthe knowledge of man\u2019s nature\n\u2014his greed for money and his\ngreed for power. And let it nev\ner be forgotten that the greed\nfor money and the greed for\npower are the same whether\nthey come to light in the enter\nprise system or whether they\nare hidden under the canopy of\na vast government bureaucracy\nswollen so that the eves can\nhardly perceive socialism in all\nits grandeur. You can \u201cthrow\nthe rascals out\" when rascality\nis revealed in the enterprise sys\ntem. The infection that comes\nwith rascality is limited in the\nenterprise system. It is not at\nall pervasive. It is the devil to\n\"throw the rascals out\" of gov\nernment. Look at Massachusetts.\nLook at New York City. The in\nfection from rascality is per\nvasive in direct proportion to\nthe size of government.\nIn conclusion, if I may join in\nyour world for a minute. I\nshould like to pose a question\nand then answer it in part. How\nwould I teach economics in the\npublic schools if I were a\nteacher?\nFirst, I would relate econom\nics \u2014 the earning of a living\u2014\nto a scale of values. Even when\nthe child had arrived at a ma\nturity where be could under\nstand some complex economic\nconcepts, I would make sure\nthat those concepts were related\nto a value scale. The foremost\nvalue man has on earth is free\ndom. His freedom of worship,\nhis choice of work, his \"life,\nliberty and pursuit of happi\nness\" rest on total freedom.\nAnything which touches and in\nfringes on his freedom is to be\ntwice reviewed, twice weighed.\nAnd ye<t, as Woodrow Wilson\nsaid of the Federal Reserve Sys\ntem in his first Inaugural Ad\ndress: \u201cWe shall deal with our\neconomic system as it is and as\nit may be modified, not as it\nmight lx* if we had a clean\nsheet of paper to write upon,\nand step by step we shall make\nit what it should be.\"\nI should teach economics with\nin a framework of history, and\nparticularly American history.\nThe experiences raflected in the\nideas of the Pounding Fathers\nare meaningful to me. The fact\nthat America was a republic\nwould be important to teach.\nThe fact that democracy is not\nan end in itself but is a bastion\nof freedom is significant. The\nfact that democracy is the most\nexpensive and cumbersome form\ngovernment man has ever de\nvised and yet is the best that\nman has ever devised is basic.\nHuman nature and the foibles\nof man must be interwoven with\neconomics, for man is greedy.\nMan has a bust for power. In\nwhatever governmental moulds\nor in whatever economic frame\nwork he has his being, these hu\nman traits of man are there and\nmust be weighed. The fact that\nwe had a division of powers in\nour Federal Government was\nbrought about because this thirst\nof mu for power was not to be\ntrusted. T should not list these\n1 to my pupils in drill sergeant\n| fashion in the fifth grade, but I\nI should w cave them in and\ni weave them in again, and at the\n: conclusion of my course during\ntheir high school period I should\nrequire them to repeat them to\nme on paper as being the over\nriding environment within which\nany economic system lias to\nfunction and within which man\nhas the necessity of making a\nchoice.\n1 If I were teaching economics\nin the primary grades, I should\nstart with very simple concepts.\nOne would lx* that the better\ntools people have, the better job\nthey can do. I should illustrate\nthe difference in tools by using\na piece of paper as an eraser\non the blackboard and then by\nusing a good eraser. I should\npoint out as I observe my boys\ntrading candy bars how that act\nwas illustrative of long, long ago\nwhen the cobbler traded his ex\ntra pair ot shoes to the miller\nfor a barrel of flour. I should be\ninclined to take them to a bak\nery and show them that when\nmother bought a loaf of bread\nshe was hiring all the people in\nthe bakery and the farmer who\ngrew the wheat. They can early\nlearn a basic economic truth\nthat the customer is king: the\ncustomer is the real employer.\nIf the bread is not too good,\nthen th(' people who work in the\nbakery do not have jobs.\nIn the first two grades I have\npresumed that the child has es\ntablished himself and increas\ningly found his place in the\nhome and in the school. In the\nthird and fourth grades the\nchild can develop awareness\nthat the community in which he\nlives is dependent upon the pur\nchase of the products of iiis\ntown by the people of other\ncommunities. Richmond sup\nports Detroit by buying automo\nbiles; Detroit supports Rich\nmond by buying cigarettes. He\nthen has learned the basic truth\nof a profound modem economic\nevolution: namely, the Common\nMarket of Europe. I would at\nthis point introduce the concept\nof how all members of a com\nmunity are dependent on one an\nother. At this stage it seems\nwise to point out how thrift en\nables one to invest in tools and\nput those tools to use. Practic\ning thrift enables the family to\nhave better tools. Money is\nearned by providing something\npeople want. All children can\nunderstand what wants are.\nAs we move into the fifth,\nsixth, and seventh grades, where\nI assume American history and\nVirginia history are going to be\ntaught, the child has begun to\nhear at home and to understand\nthat there is only .so much mon\ney tn the family and that a\nfchoice has to be made between\na baseball glove or a football.\nI would take my class to Co\nlonial Williamsburg and let\nthem see that magnificent twen\nty-minute movie. \u201cThe Story of\na Patriot.\" I would use that\ncompelling picture for several\nweeks as one of the great intro\nductions to economics and the\ninescapable interweaving of lib\nerty. and government, and taxa\ntion. I would talk about taxation\nto provide the Police Force in\nRichmond, the Pile Department,\nthe garbage collection, as well\nas talk about taxation for the\nFederal Government. One can\nincrease the breadth anG com\nplexity of economic concepts as\nthe child moves through the\nhigh school years. Always the\nstory will be the same, repeated\nin ithe language of the then cur\nrent grade \u2014 history, human na\nture, economics \u2014 intertwined,\ninterwoven, and inextricable.\nAnd so, economics must be\ntaught in our public schools.\nFirst, economics is so interwov\nen with both the history of\nman and the nature of man\nthat he cannot escape it. Ac\ncordingly, he must understand\nit \u2014 its roots and how the par\nticular economic system he\nselects functions and differs\nfrom other economic systems.\nSecond, economics is the art\nand the science of structuring\nthe framework within which\nall pupils wrill earn their liv\ning from nine to five o'clock.\nThird, there is abysmal ignor\nance of the historic American\neconomic system \u2014 the enter\nprise system. This system has\nbrought us in two and one\nhalf centuries to our present\neminence, and is historically\ninterwoven with our freedom\nand our dread of great cen\ntralized power.\nFourth, Government is increas\ningly penetrating our econom\nic decisions. Knowledge of eco\nnomics is essential if voting is\nto be intelligent.\nFifth, our economic system is\ninextricably tied up with our\nbasic freedoms \u2014 freedom to\nchoose the work we love,\nfreedom to worship, freedom\nto select those who govern us\n\u2014Freedom in the long run is\nindivisible...\nThank you.\n\u201c('ling to it Ions enough, anil\nnot xi doubt\nIt will turn true again, for so\nit goes\nMost of the change we think we\nsee in life\nIs due to truths being in and\nout of favor . .\n\u2014Robert Frost\nNews In Fruit And\nVegetable Markets\nReported At VPI\nTime, trouble, and storage\nspace needs may be cist for\napple storage and packing house\noperators as a result of a pallet\nbox filler for apples now being\ntested by the Agricultural Mar\nketing Service.\nRobert P.

Animal husbandmen at VPI\nhave summarized their uses.\nThey say you can't afford not\nto use stilbestrol in the feed lot\nfor steers and heifers destined\nfor slaughter. Use 10 mgs. per\nday in the feed, or 24 mgs. as\nan implant, for all cattle over\n500 pounds.\nStilbestrol is practical for\nbeef catfle on pasture when\nused as a 12 mg. implant on an\nimals over 500 pounds.\nUsing stilbestrol in wintering\nrations is not .practical except\nwith high level rations that give,\nmore than one pound daily gain.\nGenerally, the animal hus\nbandmen believe stilbestrol is\npractical for use on pasture fol\nlowed by use in the feed lot.\nHowever, they're not so suit\nabout using it in the wintering\nration, then on pasture followed\nby feed lot treatment. This may\n! be too much. Stilbestrol is not\nrecommended for show cattle or\n4-H club steers.\nThe specialists say to use stil\nbestrol on cattle destined for\n| slaughter only, do not overdose\ni under any circumstance, and\n! withdraw it from feed 48 hours\nbefore slaughter.\nResults with synovex are about\nthe same as with stilbestrol.\ni Use standard dose in ail cases.\nAntibiotics are best used . to\nget new cattle settled and on\nfeed. Antibiotics generally will\nresult in an average of six per\ncent increase in gains and sligh\ntly improved efficiency. When\ncombined with stilbestrol. an\ntibiotics generally have not giv\nen any better results than stil\nbestrol alone. Slaughter yields\nare usually improved when an\ntibiotics are used.\nIf you decide to use antibiotics,\n80 mgs. per day for 30 days\nwill usually get new cattle start\ned with a minimum of digestive\nupsets. Antibiotics tend to pro\nmote good hair growth on young\ncattle, and do have a place in\nfeed for show cattle and 4-H\nsteers. It's also all right to use\nantibiotics for breeding cattle.\nTranquilizers have shown no\nconsistent benefit when used in\n| feed. They do help quiet calves\n| When weaning Is troublesome,\nj However, good management and\nfeeding will give better results\nthan a tranquilizer. Use tran\nqulizers as an aid in special\ncases, not us a substitute for\nmanagement.\nTranquilizers are good for\nshipping show cattle, but should\nnot be used for slaughter cattle\ngoing to market, because of\nbruises wlvere the needle is in\njected.\nThe specialists caution that\ntranquilizers should be given by\nan experienced person. Over\ndosing can have disastrous re\nsults in shipping. Overdosed\ncattle will lie down in transit\nand will not roll with or adjust\nto the motion of the truck.\nNew Insecticide\nIs Discovered\nA chemical t\u00abiat \u201cplucks the\nheartstrings\" of the male of a\ntroublesome insect has been iso\nlated and synthesized.\nNow thfc male American roach\nis going to have its love-life at\ntract it to its death.\nThe attractant will not be\navailable tomorrow at the corn\ner drug store.

C.. the Chi\nnese philosopher Mencius, when asked\nby Kink Hwuy for advice on how to\nrun (he country, drew a picture of the\npoliticians of those days which very\nmuch resembles the politicians of to\nday.\n\"And these are your politicians\" said\nMencius, \"the only true practical phi\nlosophers of the world (as they think\nthemselves), so full of gravity\n(graft?), such professional lovers of\nvirtue and honesty\u2014what wretches be\nthey in ev*ery deed; how vile and con\ntemplable! O, Man, what ado thou\nmakes!\"\nUpon another occasion, back 23-hun\ndred years ago, King Hwuy asked phi\nlosopher Mencius for a little advice on\nkingly behavior, to which the latter\nreplied, \"Is there any difference in\nkilling a man with a stick and with\na sword.\" Mencius answered that there\nwas nf) difference in killing a man on\na battlefield and starving him in the\npoorhouse.\nThen Mecius levelled his finger at the\nking and said, \"In your stalls are fat\nhorses but your people have the look\nof hunger and in the fields are those\nwho die of famine. Is there any dif\nference,\" he went on, \"in creating such\nconditions with the sword or by gov\nernment Bowers,\" meaning by wars or\nby laws protecting the rich.\nThe law is always ready to help those\nwho hflvr, by any hook or crook, get\nand keep the advantage over all others.\nThe rich can rob the poor\u2014that's the\nway they got rich in the first place\u2014\nand nothing is done about it, but let\nthe poor rob the rich\u2014or take back\nthat which has been stolen by the rich\nand see what a hubbub is let loose.\nBut if dumb old China can get an\nidea in her head then there's hope for\nthe rest of us. One of China's great\nest handicaps has been floods, especial\nly along the Yangtze river.\n\"old\" China ever did about it was to\nset up stone bulls along the river banks\nwhich, it was said,\nlooking up the river\nfloods from coming down. So, for cen\nturies, nothing else was done about it.\nEven as late as 1931 the authorities\nasked the \"old\" engineers \"how long it\nwould take\" to build a dam across the\nriver. They puckered their brows and\nsaid \"about four years.\" Some 20 years\nlater \"new engineers\" said\nSo some 300,000 men took up their tools\nand went to work. They finished the\nhalf-mile dam in 75 days. As a result\n1,500,000 acres of previously flooded\nland now supplies half a million tons\nof rice and a big yield of cotton to the\nChinese people.\nObviously there is an\nall working together, not each oppos\ning, even trying to\neven all others. Human life is like the\ncell-life in your body. If the cells in\nyour body constantly made war on each\nother your wracked and wrecked body\nwould soon be on its way to that quiet\n(at least) resting place.

Any other ideology is emphat\nically NOT socialism.\nTrue, both Hitler and Mussolini\nCLAIMED to be socialists before they\nrose to power. They simply used that\nmethod of securing power because in\nboth countries there was a strong trend\nto a socialist ideology and they, like\nmany of our old line politicians in\nown country, adopted some socialist\nideas or suggestions to secure power\nfor themselves and once that position\nIB\narticle o n\n(Voice of\nn\npro\ns\n\u2022 \u25a0III\nof power was secured they gave their\ncountries anything else but socialism.\nWe have seen the same thing going on\nduring the'New Deal\u2014Fair Deal period.\nHitler and Mussolini were both dic\ntators and your true socialist insists\nthat there can be no dictatorship un\nder a socialst economy. It may be that\nMarie Eaton has been misled by the oft\nrepeated claims of Hitler's \"National\nSocialism\" into the belief that his\nclaims to socialism were true and she\nhas fallen into the error, common to\nmany, of really believing that Hitler\nwas giving Germany a brand of soc\nialism (you remember that Adolph him\nself said that if you told a lie big\nenough and repeated it often enough\npeople would come to believe it.) How\never, I am of the opinion that her use\nof the terms \"fascist-socialism,\" and\n\"socialist-fascist ideology\" were simp\nly unfortunate, for her letter indicates\nthat she is sufficiently well informed\nto know better, and were it not for\nthe erroneous impression they might\ncreate I would not offer this criticism.\nThere is a world-wide trend toward\na socialist economy at the present time\nand it has been in progress for decades.\n(Oh yes, we have it even in the U. S. A.)\nUnfortunately here, as in other coun\ntries it is the \"creeping\" kind, not\nthe kind that advances boldly as so\ncialists would prefer it. In this coun\ntry we see it exemplified especially\nduring the \"New Deal\u2014^Fair Deal\" pe\nriod by the politicians of both old par\nties purloining a few planks from the\nsocialist platforms and advancing\nthemselves to positions of power be\ncause of the appeal those planks made\nto the voting public.\nA returned G. I. once said to\nthat lie wasn't a socialist because he\nhad seen to many socialist countries. I\nwas compelled to inform him that he\nhad not yet seen ANY socialist coun\ntries beceause there were none at the\npresent time. True, some countries\nhave made the first faltering- steps\ntoward a socialist economy, New Zea\nland, the Scandinavian countries, Great\nBritain and Russia. Britain with her\nnationalization of a few major indus\ntries, Mexico with her nationalization\nof petroleum, and Russia. Russia has\nI believe gone the farthest toward\nsocialist program, from the informa\ntion I could gather before Churchill\nand the American press dropped their\n\"iron curtain\" of secrecy and censor\nship over news coming from that coun\ntry. But even in Russia they operate\n(if we may believe the press) under a\ndictatorship, and dictatorship is\ntirely foreign to the real, modern,\nciaiist ideology of democratic co-opera\ntion .\nHulett Johnson (Dean of Canterbury)\nwrote several books dealing with the\nRussian methods prior to and during\nWorld War II, which indicated that\nRussian industry was then operating\non a more democratic basis than\nhere in the U. S. A., and I took the op\nportunity upon several occasions (one\nespecially \u00e0 speaker who was speaking\non behalf fo the war effort) to in\nquire of people who had traveled in\nRussia if these books gave an ac\ncurate picture of conditions existing in\nRussia and the reply was invariably\nthat they did. This was at a time when\nRussia was an ally and there was no\nreason to misrepresent facts.\nNow of course, we need not, and\nshould not, accept as gospel what the\nRussians tell us, nor should we accept\nas gospel the things that our own\npropagaandists tell us about Russia,\nboth sides will be. and are, prejudiced.\nConsequently we should hear all the\narguments on both sides and draw\nour own conclusions.

Joe Miller, Wednesday,' an\nnounced that he will resign his po\nsition as chairman and executive di\nre. or of the Montana Unemployment\nCompensation Commission on Janu\nary 5, effective at the earliest pos\nsible date at the discretion of the in\ncoming Governor, Hugo Aronson.\n\"I have offered,\" Mr. Miller said,\n\"my fullest co-operation with Gover\nnor Aronson to the end that the\ntransition to my successor may not\ninterrupt the direct local office coun\nter payment of unemployment insur\nance benefits to qualified unemploy\ned workers, both civilian and vet\neran, or\nto employers and jobseekers.\"\nMiller was appointed to head the\ncommission on March 1, 1950. In an\nnouncing his resignation he pointed\nto major advancements made under\nhis chairmanship, citing direct pay\nment of claims at the local office,\nmaintenance of current wage rec\nords, notification to employers of\nclaims matters affecting them, actu\narial study of the unemployment in\nsurance system, curbing of fraudu\nlent inroads upon the fund, and Cul\ntivation of cordial understanding be\ntween employers, workers, and the\ncommission, of their rights and re\nsponsibilities under the laws.\n\"The study on benefit financing,\nMiller said, \"furnishes lawmakers\nand the public with a sound fiscal\nbasis for adjusting the insurance plan\nto meet changing economic condi\ntions. It points out Montana's unique\nposition of being financially able to\nincrease the range of weekly bene\nfits and at the same time reduce pay\nroll tax paid by employers, without\ndepleting the reserve fund.\"\nToday's figures on that fund show\nalmost $40,000,000 in reserve, as\ncompared with nearly $30,000,000\n' *\nthink for ourselves on the basis of\nfacts.\nAnd our educators and school sys\ntems might adopt two age-old mot\ntoes as their criterions, One: from Vol\ntaire \"I totally disagree with every\nthing you say but will defend to the\ndeath your right to say it;\" and the\nother from Thomas Jefferson, \"Error of\nopinion may be tolerated so long as\nreason is left free to combat it.\"\n1 flood waers to provide an additional\nwater supply for the 55,700-acre Belle\nFourche Reclamation Project in wes\ntei'n South Dakota. A capacity is pro\nvided in Keyhole Reservoir for stor\ning water allocated to Wyoming un\nder the Belle Fourche River compact\nfor irrigation of Wyoming lands.\nRegional Director Vernon ex\nplained that irrigation and power\nproduction are only two of the\nmultiple purposes of the basin\nwide program. Wherever water is\nstored, facilities are included in\nthe unit plan for other purposes\nsuch as the control of floods, re\ntention of silt, abatement of pollu\ntion, provision of domestic and\nmunicipal water supplies, expan\nsion of recreational possibilities,\nenhancement of fish and wildlife\nhabitat, and other beneficial uses.\nDuring 1952, large-scale construc\ntion activities also were under way\non Canyon Ferry Dam and Power\nPlant on the Missouri River near\nHelena, Mont., and on the irriga\ntion distribution system for the 12,\n000 acre Angostura Unit near Hot\nSprings, S. D., (Angostura Dam was\ncompleted in 1949, the 1,200-kilo\nwatt power plant in 1951.)\nstruction of Canyon Ferry Unit was\nstarted in 1949 and present sched\nules call for work to be virtually\ncompleted in 1953. The unit is the\n\"key\" to future development in the\nMissouri Basin upstream from Fort\nBenton, Mont., Vernon said. Conser\nvation of Missouri River flows in the\n2,050,000 acre-foot reservoir will\nmake possible the generation of\nabout 300 million kilowatt hours of\nelectrical energy annually from the\n50,000-kilowatt Canyon Ferry Power\nPlant and indirectly make possible\nthe irrigation of more than 300,000\nacres of land and the provision of\nCon\nI when Miller took office 34 months\nago.\n\" A11 the many changes,\nadded, \"were instituted in direct re\n\u2022 '\nMiller\nsponse to the requirements of the\nMontana and related federal laws.\nCompilation of complete wage records\nof employees in covered industry,\nnotification to employers of claims\nby farmer, employees, actuarial and j\neconomic study of the operation of 1\nthe program, and promptness in de - 1\nlivery of benefit checks are all part(\nof the long-standing requirements.\nThe payment of benefits to quali\nfied unemployed workers at the lo\ncal office of the employment service\nat the time they report a week of un\nemployment is looked upon by. the\nretiring chairman as an outstanding\ncontribution of his term.

As a part of the Missouri\nRiver Basin Project, the Bureau has\ncompleted or placed under construc\ntion more than 2,300 miles of lines\nand 44 substations. As a part of the\nFort Peck, Riverton, and Shoshone\noperating projects, the Bureau has\ncompleted construction of about 1,\n160 miles of transmission lines and\n40 substations. The Dawson County\nSubstation near Glendive, Mont., a\npart of the Fort Peck Project, is\nnearing completion.\nDuring 1952, the Bureau of\nReclamation awarded about $29\nmillion in construction and supply\ncontracts for features of the Mis\nsouri Basin Project on which work\nwas under way in Region 6.\nIn addition, the Bureau awarded\ncontracts totaling $114 million for\nwork on five of the eleven operating\nReclamation projects in Region 6 au\nthorized and built prior to the passage\nof the Flood Control Act which, to\ngether with subsequent legislation,\nauthorized the basin-wide program.\nThe eleven projects include 580,000\nacres of irrigable land and work is\nunder way or planned to increase\nthe irrigable acreage on two of the\nprojects by almost 43,000 acres.\nThe Regional Director emphasized\nthat the Reclamation program is ac\ntive in other phases that are pre\nrequisite to construction and that Re\nl Ki\u00b0 n 6 has an extensive investigation\nand preconstruction program in prog\nf ess ma ka definite-detailed stud\nj es proposed developments lead\n^he fi na i preparation of de\nsi 8' ns and specifications for construc\ntion > the layout of farm unit plans,\nand related work.

I nr.\nTHE author has spent about half his adult life in his\nnative Austria, in close touch with German thought,\nand the other half in the United States and England.\nIn the latter period he has become increasingly con\nvinced THAT SOME OF THE FORCES WHICH DE\nSTROYED FREEDOM IN GERMANY ARE ALSO AT\nWORK HERE.\nThe very magnitude of the outrages committed by\nthe National Socialists has strengthened the assurance\nthat a totalitarian system cannot happen here. But let\nus remember that 15 years ago the possibility of such a\nthing happening in Germany would have appeared JUST\nAS FANTASTIC not only to nine-tenths of the Germans\nthemselves, but also to the most hostile foreign observer.\nThere are many features which were then re\ngarded as \u201ctypically German\u201d which are now equally\nfamiliar in America and England, and many symptoms\nthat point to a further development in the same direc\ntion: the increasing veneration for the state, the fatal\nistic acceptance of \u201cinevitable trends,\u201d the enthusiasms\nfor \u201c organization\u201d of everything (we now call it\n\u201c planning\u201d ).\nThe character of the danger is, if possible, even\nLESS UNDERSTOOD HERE than it was in Germany.\nThe supreme tragedy is still not seen that in Ger\nmany it was largely people of good will who, by their\nsocialist policies, PREPARED THE WAY for the forces\nwhich stand for everything they detest. \u2022\nFew recognize that the rise of fascism and nazism\nwas not a reaction against the socialist trends of the\npreceding period. BUT A NECESSARY OUTCOME OF\nTHOSE TENDENCIES.\nYet it is significant that many leaders, from Musso\nlini down (and including Laval and Quisling) BEGAN\nAS SOCIALISTS AND ENDED AS FASCISTS OR\nNAZIS.\n\u2022 \u00ab \u2022\nIN THE democracies at present, many who sincerely\nhate all of nazism\u2019s manifestations are working for\nideals whose realization would lead straight to the ab\nhorred tyranny.\nMost of the people whose views influence develop\nments are in some measure socialists. They believe that\nour economic life should be \u201cconsciously directed.\u201d that\nwe should substitute \u201ceconomic planning\u201d for the com\npetitive system.\nYet is there a greater tragedy imaginable than that,\nin our endeavor consciously to shape our future in ac\ncordance with high ideals, we should in fact unwittingly\nPRODUCE THE VERY OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE\nHAVE BEEN STRIVING FOR*\nPlanning and Power\nIn order to achieve their ends, the planners must\nCREATE POWER\u2014power over men wielded by other\nmen\u2014of a magnitude never before known.\nTheir success will depend on the extent to which\nthey achieve such power.\nDemocracy is an obstacle to this suppression of\nfreedom which the centralized direction of economic\nactivity requires. HENCE ARISES THE CLASH BE\nTWEEN PLANNING AND DEMOCRACY.\nMany socialists have the tragic illusion that by\ndepriving private individuals of the power they possess\nin an individualist system, and transferring this power\nto society, they thereby extinguish power. \u00ab\nWhat thev overlook is that, bv CONCENTRATING\nPOWER SO THAT IT CAN BE USED IN THE SERV\nICE OF A SINGLE PLAN. IT IS NOT MERELY\nTRANSFORMED, BUT INFINITELY HEIGHTENED.\nBy uniting in the hands of some single body power\nformerly exercised independently by many, an amount\nof power is created INFINITELY GREATER than any\nthat existed before, so much more far-reaching as almost\nto be different in kind.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nIT IS entirely fallacious to argue that the great power\nexercised by a central planning board would be \u201cno\ngreater than the power collectively exercised by private\nboards of directors.\u201d\nThere is, in a competitive society, nobody who can\nexercise even a fraction of the power which a socialist\nplanning board would possess.\nTo decentralize power is to reduce the absolute\namount of power, and the competitive system is the\nonly system designed to minimize the power exercised\nby man over man.\nWho can seriously doubt that the power which a\nmillionaire, who mav be mv employer, has over me IS\nVERY MUCH LESS THAN THAT WHICH THE\nSMALLEST BUREAUCRAT POSSESSES WHO\nWIELDS THE COERCIVE POWER OF THE STATE\nAND ON WHOSE DISCRETION IT DEPENDS HOW\nI AM ALLOWED TO LIVE AND WORK?\nIn every real sense a badly paid unskilled work\nman in this country has MORE FREEDOM to shape his\nlife than many an employer in Germany or a much better\npaid engineer or manager in Russia.\nIf he wants to change his job or the place where he\nlives, if he wants to profess certain views or spend his\nleisure in a particular way, he faces no absolute impedi\nments.\nTHERE ARE NO DANGERS TO BODILY SECUR\nITY AND FREEDOM THAT CONFINE HIM BY\nBRUTE FORCE TO THE TASK AND ENVIRONMENT\nTO WHICH A SUPERIOR HAS ASSIGNED HIM.\n\u2022 \u2022 t\nOUR generation has forgotten that the system of\nprivate property is the most important guaranty of\nfreedom.\nIt is onlv because the control of the means of pro\nduction is DIVIDED AMONG MANY PEOPLE ACTING\nINDEPENDENTLY that we as individuals can decide\nwhat to do with ourselves.\nWhen all the means of production are vested in a\nsingle hand, whether it be nominally that of \u201c society\u201d\nas a whole or that of a dictator, whoever exercises this\ncontrol has complete power over us.\nIn the hands of private individuals, what is called\neconomic power can be an instrument of coercion, but\nit is never control over the whole life of a person. But\nwhen economic power is CENTRALIZED AS AN IN\nSTRUMENT OF POLITICAL POWER it creates a\ndegree of dependence scarcely distinguishable from\nslavery.\nIt has been well said that, in a country where the\nsole employer is the state, opposition means death by\nslow starvation.\nBackground to Danger\nIndividualism, in contrast to socialism and all other\nforms of totalitarianism, is based on the respect of\nChristianity for the individual man and the belief that\nit is desirable that men should be free to develop their\nown individual gifts and bents.\nThis philosophy, first fully developed during the\nRenaissance, grew and spread into what we know as\nwestern civilization. The general direction of social\ndevelopment was one of freeing the individual from the\nties which bound him in feudal society.\nPerhaps the greatest result of this unchaining of\nindividual energies was the marvelous growth of science.\nOnly since industrial freedom opened the path to\nthe free use of new knowledge, only since everything\ncould be tried\u2014if somebody could be found to back it\nat his own risk\u2014has science made the great strides\nwhich in the last 150 years have changed the face of\nthe world.\nThe result of this growth surpassed all expectations.\nWherever the barriers to the free exercise of human in\ngenuity were Removed, man became rapidly able to satisfy\never-widening ranges of desire.\nBv the beginning of the twentieth century the work\ning man in the western world had reached a degree of\nmaterial comfort, security and personal independence\nwhich 100 years before had hardly seemed possible.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nTHE effect of this success was to create among men\na new sense of power over their own fate, the belief\nin the unbounded possibilities of improving their own lot.\nWhat had been achieved came to be regarded as a\nsecure and imperishable possession, acquired once and\nfor all; and the rate of progress began to seem too slow.\nMoreover, the principles which had made this prog\nress possible came to be regarded as obstacles to speedier\nprogress, impatiently to be brushed away.\nIT MIGHT BE SAID THAT THE VERY SUCCESS\nOF LIBERALISM BECAME THE CAUSE OK ITS\nDECLINE.\nNo sensible person should have doubted that the\neconomic principles of the nineteenth century were only\na beginning\u2014that there were immense possibilities of\nadvancement on the lines on which we had moved.\nBut according to the views now dominant , the\nquestion is no longer how we can make the best use of\nthe spontaneous forces found in a free society. We have\nin effect undertaken to dispense with these force* and\nto replace them by collective and \u201cconscious\u201d direction.\nIt is significant that this abandonment of liberalism,\nwhether expressed as socialism in its more radical form\nor merelv as \u201corganization\u201d or \"planning,\u201d was PER\nFECTED IN GERMANY.\nDuring the last quarter of the nineteenth century\nand the first quarter of the twentieth. Germany moved\nfar ahead in both the theory and the practice of social\nism. so that even today Russian discussion largely carries\non where the Germans left off.\nTHE GERMANS, LONG BEFORE THE NAZIS,\nWERE ATTACKING LIBERALISM AND DEMOC\nRACY. CAPITALISM AND INDIVIDUALISM.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nIONG before the Nazis, too, the German and Italian*\n.J Socialists were using techniques of which the Nazis\nand Fascists later made effective u<*e.\nThe idea of a political party which embraces all ac\ntivities of the individual from the cradle to the grave,\nwhich claims to guide his views, on everything, was put\ninto practice by the Socialists.\nIt was not the Fascists but the Socialists who began\nto collect children at the tenderest age into political\norganizations to direct their thinking.\nIt was not the Fascists but the Socialists who first\nthought of organizing sports and games, football and\nhiking, in party clubs where the members would not be\ninfected by other views.\nIt was the Socialists who first insisted that the\nparty member should distinguish himself from others\nby the modes of greeting and the forms of address.\nIt was they who. by their organization of \u201ccells\u201d and\ndevices for the permanent supervision of private life,\nCREATED THE PROTOTYPE OF THE TOTALI\nTARIAN PARTY.\nBy the time Hitler came to power, liberalism was\ndead in Germany. And it was socialism that had killed it.\nTo many who have watched the transition from\nsocialism to fascism at close quarters the connection\nbetween the two systems has become increasingly obvi\nous, but in the democracies the majority of people still\nbelieve that socialism and freedom can be combined.\nTHEY DO NOT REALIZE THAT DEMOCRATIC\nSOCIALISM, THE GREAT UTOPIA OF THE LAST\nFEW GENERATIONS.

As usual I could not help noticing\nthat some of the whiskers were longer than others. This\nhas always puzzled me. \"Why in the same length of time\ndoes one whisker grow longer and stronger than others\nof its fellow whiskers?\", I have often asked myself.\nGrowing in the same soil, or rather I should say same\nskin, blood and flesh alongside of a puny runt, a healthy,\nvirile whisker blossoms forth. Just why I have never been\nable to figure out. But when my razor has gotten in its\nlicks, all of the whiskers, both healthy and puny, are re\nduced to the same size\u2014that is, no size at all. It must be\nplumb discouraging to a healthy whisker that has toiled\nnight and day to gain stature, to be mowed down to the\nsize of the shiftless, non-toiling bit of fuzz.\nOn this particular morning it suddenly dawned on\nme that what that razor was doing to the individual whis\nkers 011 my face is exactly what socialism does to the indi\nviduals of a nation. It cuts them all down to one size, that\nis, no size at all.\nUnder a socialistic economy the hard-working, thrifty,\nself-reliant individual is reduced to the same size as the\nshiftless, wasteful, reliant citizen. Struggle as he may,\nconstantly he is cut down. Finally, he loses all incentive\nto attempt to lift himself above his fellows and discour\naged, he throws up his arms in surrender and ceases to\nstruggle.\nThe theory of socialism is beautiful\u2014the idea of all\nsharing alike is intriguing; especially for those who have\nlittle or nothing to share. But socialism in practice, that\nis something else again. The end result is that all do not\nshare alike\u2014each finishes up with a large equal slice of\nnothing. For you reduce the honeybee^ to the status\nof the drones, \u03af\u03ca\u03af> honey is produced.\n.But tnere is sometmng socialism creates tnai is wuisc\nthan poverty, uncomfortable as that status is, and that\nthing is loss of freedom. Loss of freedom goes hand in\nhand with socialism. Those in charge of the dividing\nprocess have a nasty habit of dictating how each recipient\nof the division shall spend his share.\nThe citizen of the socialistic state is told where and\nat what he shall work, how to live, how he shall\neducate his children, what doctor and dentist shall serve\nhim; he is even told how to entertain himself. If you\ndoubt the foregoing statement, just ask any Englishman.\nThe English have learned the hard way, that under a\nsocialistic government they not only were ruled and regu\nlated to the hilt, but were gradually coming to share less\nand less. Let's hope that they did not awaken too late\nand that the Churchill government will be able to restore\ntheir lost freedoms and lift their standard of living from\nthe low level to which it has sunk.\nOf course, those who started socialism upon England\nwere honest about it. They called it,*\"Socialism.\" Those\nwho are trying to force socialism upon America are not so\nforthright. They have a lot of fancy, misleading names\nfor it, such as, ''Social Security,\" \"Compulsory Medicine,\"\n\"Public Housing,\" etc., etc. They know that were they\nto call it by its right name, the American people would\navoid it like a plague.\nThe editor of the Dayton (Ohio) Press, in an editorial\npointing out how lucky we Americans are, made this very\ntrue and wise observation: \"The farther you move from\nfreedom the more you pay for a life that is worth less tc\nlive.\"\nThat would seem to be a high note on which to end\nthis piece, bearing the unusual title, \"Thoughts While\nShaving.\"\nWHEN YOU USE YOUR\nVOICE AS MUCH AS I DO,\nyouVe GOT TO THINK OF\nYOUR THROAT.

When it is destroy\ned it brings disaster.\nA nation's wealth is its life's\nblock. The downfall of most na\ntions has been preceded by the\ndepreciation of their currencies.\nManpower and military equip\nment is of no avail if there is no\nmeans of feeding the men or sup\nplying and servicing the macch\ninery. One great English financi\ner said, \"Let me control the\nmoney of a nation and I care not\nwho makes the laws for the na\ntion, I will control the nation.\"\nParasites not only do not produce\nbut they also destroy stability\nand durability of a nation.\nThis nation appears to be en\ntering an era when all its re\nsources of every kind may have\nto be taxed to the very limit. It\nappears that over a long period\nthe nation to survive must spend\nbillions of dollars for self defense.\nTo succeed the nation must guard\nagainst allowing its wealth being\nsiphoned off by internal para\nsites.\nEvery dollar diverted from buy\ning the means of self defense into\npolitical hand-outs or unnecess\nary payments of any kind or\nover payments of any kind is\nhelping destroy our national de\nfense.\nThe nation to remain free and\nindependent must gird itself for\na long hard battle. It must be\nwilling to accept privation and\nself discipline. If parsites are to\ncontrol the policies and direct the\nfunctions of government the hope\nof freedom is lost. There must be\na choice between a government\nfor parasties or a government\nfor loyal liberty loving people.\nMinette Graham\nJoins Winthrop Club\nROCK HILL, S.

We are all\ndependent on one another,\nevery soul of us on earth.\"\n\u2014 George Bernard Shaw\nAs a new American, this suggestion may seem\nxm. presumptuous \u2014 but I\u2019d like to propose a\nnew kind of holiday. I would call it \u201cDepend\nence Day.\u201d\nFor generations, Americans have, quite rightly,\nbeen celebrating July 4 as the day of our political\nindependence. But on my holiday people will\nthink about their human interdependence.\nOn this day people will set aside a little time,\nonly a few moments perhaps, to reflect upon and\ngive thanks for our vital dependence upon one\nanother. Dependents will count their dependents.\nEveryone will contemplate the vast number of\npeople he is dependent upon. It will be a day to\nthink about our relationships as husbands and\nwives, parents and children, bosses and workers,\ncity dwellers and country folk.\nWe will all recognize each other on Dependence\nDay. Passers-by will smile in greeting. Strang\ners\u2014mutually dependent people who haven't\nbeen introduced \u2014 will exchange some word or\nsign to act out our appreciation of our depend\nence upon each other.\nIt will be a day of friendship and recognition\nof and for \u2014 all of us.\nNo guns will be fired. There will be no fire\nworks to mark the day, no speeches, no martial\nmusic. The observation of Dependence Day will\ntake place in a man\u2019s own mind and heart, not\nin his ears. It doesn\u2019t call for signs or badges or\nsymbols. For most of all, this will be an occasion\nfor quiet thought.\nAfter all, who is really \"independent\u201d today?\nNobody. What person or state is truly \"sover\neign\u201d? None.\nThe very nature of modem life means that all\nof us are increasingly dependent on each other.\nWe will survive only if we can find some way to\nremember that fact, and act accordingly.\nMaybe Dependence Day will help us to\nremember.\nOM THE COVES.

Benson, President Harding College)\nSome readers may have wondered from time to time\nwhy I have so persistently warned of the danger of a\nprolonged practice of deficit financing (operating on\nborrowed money) by our Federal government. The rea\nson is thai runaway inflation is disasterous, and if there\nis a single economic law on which virtually all econo\nmists can agree it is the one that says government deficit\nspending inevitably brings on and feeds inflation.\nIn Asia, in the Orient and in Europe, I have had per\nsonal contact with the havoc wrought by inflation. For\na number of years I\u2019ve carried at $10,000 currency bill\nin my waiiet. In 1935, when we left Hong Kong to re\nturn to America, this Chinese money would have bought i\na very nice home anywhere in the Orient. Today the:\n$10,000 bill would be just enough to pay for one slice of j\nbread. j\nInflation can be as destructive as defeat in war. Lenin, >\nthe father of international communism, said \u201cWe must\nforce the United States to spend itself into destruction.\u201d *\nIn opening the nationwide Crusade for Freedom with a\nradio address last month, General Eisenhower pondered\nthe possibility that present Russian strategy may be cal\nculated to force us into ruinous financial practices. Earl\nBrowder, the Communist, says in his new book that So-:\ncialism is inevitable in the Unitetd States. He gives as;\nthe foremost reason \u201cGovernment deficit financing.\u201d j\nIn its full, runaway stage, inflation creates panic and\nsometimes anarchy results; but in its first, insidious\nstages it is not likely to generate alarm among the peo\nple. That's another reason I have frequently pointed out\nthe danger. Conditions which led to the French revolu\ntion were set into motion by the Finance Ministry\u2019s!\nheavy deficit financing and resultant runaway inflation.\nHitler\u2019s National Socialism took root in a post war Ger-,\nmany prostrated by currency inflation. '\nPeople working to change our American way ot lile tOi\nSocialism or any other form of regimenting government\ngain headway by encouraging deficit spending, inflation,\nconstantly mountng national debt. Thomas Jefferson\nviewed public debt as \u201cthe greatest danger to be fear\ned.\" He said, \u201cWe must make our choice between econ\nomy and liberty of profusion and servitude.\u201d Bernard!\nBaruch recently spotlighted the danger. \u201cWhat could,\nmake people more dependent on government,\u201d he asked\na Senate committee, \u201cthan inflation?\u201d\n!\nLASH YOURSELVES TO THE MAST, MATES ! i\nEFFECTIVE OCTOBER 9\nREDUCED RATES ON ALL ROUND-TRIP FARES\nBOTH INTER-PORT IN ALASKA AND OUTSIDE\nECONOMY \u2014 Aboard The Alaska Line your fare\nincludes all meals/ first class berth and liberal\nbaggage allowance.

She\nlikes it better than diamonds. Be\nsides, she said, it\u2019s a better and\nsafer investment.\nMary Edusei spotted the double\nbed, plated with 22-carat gold, in\na London store last week and im\nmediately tested its 1,240 gleam\ning springs.\n\u201cI took one look and said, \u2018that\u2019s\nfor me\u2019,\u201d she told newsmen. \u201cI\njust knew I had to have it. Every\nwife will know how I felt.\u201d\nMrs. Edusei handed startled\nstore clerks a check for 3,000\npounds \u2014 $8,400 \u2014 and five work\nmen hauled the huge bed to her\nLondon apartment and assembled\nit in the bedroom. Mrs. Edusei\nhas been living in London while\nher new $56,000 home is being\nbuilt in Ghana.\nWhen word of the purchase\nreached Accra, her husband ad\nmitted embarrassment. He is\nGhana\u2019s Minister of Industries. De\nclaring himself the No. 1 disciple\nof President Kwame Nkrumah and\nsocialism, Edusei said such a bed\nwas \u201cnot socialism\u201d and told his\nwife: \u201cTake it back at once.\u201d\nMrs. Edusei said, however, that\nit is not up to him to decide.\n\u201cI paid for it with my own\nmoney,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has nothing\nto do with my husband.\u201d\n\u201cPeople might think I\u2019m extra\nvagant, but I believe it\u2019s safer to\nput my money in a golden bed\nwhich I use and enjoy,\u201d she went\non. \u201cI can enjoy the bed every\nnight.

I believe\nthe people are entitled to oe neara\nin this matter and a referendum\nis the fair, American way to deter\nmine their wishes. Present laws\nare inadequate and if the people\nwant prohibition, they should vote\nto strengthen the present laws.\u201d\nAnd finally, Mrs. Cain would\nutilize women ritizens by using\nthem on juries if they wish to ser\nve; by equal representation of the\nsexes on Democratic committees\nfrom the precinct to the state le\nvel; and by appointment of quali\nfied women to policy-making\nposts.\nIn conclusion Mrs. Cain said: \u201cI\nwant us to get back to the kind of\ngovernment Thomas Jefferson was\ntalking about when he said, \u2018What\nmore is necessary to make us a\nhappy and prosperous people?\nStill one thing more, fellow citi\nzens, a wise and frugal govern\nment, which shall restrain men\nfrom injuring one another, shall\nleave them otherwise free to re\ngulate their own pursuits of in\ndustry and improvement, and\nshall not take from the mouth of\nlabor the bread it has earned. This\nis the sum of good government;\nand this is necessary to close the\ncircle ol our felicities.\u2019 I want\nyou to return with me to that kind\not government.

PHILLIPS Training for Assistant Manager\nEntered as Second-class matter July 2, 1948, at the Postoffice at Phoe\nnix, Arizona, under the Act of March 3, 1879.\n4.\nA \u201cLITTLE BIT OF SOCIALISM\u201d\nThere is a saying to the effect that a \u201clittle bit of\nsocialism\u201d is a good thing for a country\u2014that it puts\nfree enterprise on its toes and keeps it humping.\nHowever, having a \u201clittle bit of socialism\u201d is much\nlike having a \u201clittle touch of leprosy.\u201d It always grows\nand feeds upon itself. And in time it consumes everything\nthat stands in its way.\nAs an example, on June 8 the New York World-Tele\ngram carried a revealing news story. It said that \u201cBritain\u2019s\nLabor government served notice that if it wins next year\u2019s\nparlimentary elections it will transform the United King\ndom into a collectivist state as soon as possible.\u201d It will\ndemand and undoubtedly enact a law giving the govern\nment permanent authority to impose rationing and other\nsuch controls. It has marked at least six more major in\ndustries for socialization, including sugar refining, meat\nwholesaling, cement making, and various forms of in\nsurance. A high labor spokesman warned that \u201cpeople\nmust be ready to change their jobs and managements to\nchange their lines of production if the need arises.\u201d He\nsaid further that private industry must watch its step.\nThe meaning and intent of all this is certainly clear.\nIf the labor party wins, \u201ca little bit of socialism\u201d will be\nmade all inclusive, and a total, regimental economy estab\nlished by the government. All the principal instruments\nof production and employment will become possessions of\nthe state. Labor will be a tool of the state, to be used in\nwhatever way the bosses think best.\nIt is only a step from this to the police state that exists\nbehind the iron curtain. When you have a dictated econ\nomy, you eventually have a dictator and lost liberty.\nPowerful political forces in the United States want us to\ngo the way of Britain, and are using every subterfuge to\nsell us on a similar program, before the people are aware\nof the danger.\nPART OF THE COMMUNITY\nFive years ago, according to an article by Bill Woolsey\nin the Nashville Tennessean Magazine, a combination of\ncircumstances caused the financial bottom to fall out of\nthe West Tennessee egg market. The price slipped to 15\ncents a dozen. Producers of eggs were desperate, and the\ncounty agents were frantic.\nThen the head of a grocery chain, which has 40 stores\nin the region, stepped into picture. A plan was made\nand approved whereby the Chain would go abruptly into\nthe wholesale egg business, and act as a receiving agent\nfor the government. The eggs flowed in, and the price\nsteadied and rose. Within two months the chain had in\nvested $50,000 in eggs. The job cost time, cash, and maybe\na headache. But it saved the egg producers.\nThe chain had performed a similar service for farm\ners before, during the depression, when corn was practical\nly being given away. It built a plant to convert local corn\ninto finished products. The result was a cash market for\nthe farmer\u2019s corn\u2014and corn products for the consumer\nat a low price.\nThis particular chain is typical of the industry of which\nit is a part. It began as a single corner store with $3,000\nworking capital. Now it serves 24 counties in two states\nand last year did more than $5,500,000 in trade. And its\nwhole philosophy has been founded on two ideas. One is\nthe consumer should be given the benefits of large volume\nand economical operation, in the form of the lowest pos\nsible prices. The other is that the farmer must have a good\ndependable market. The result has been progress for all.\nThe good retailer, whether he be a chain or an in\ndependent, thinks in terms of the welfare of the com\nmunities and farming districts he serves. He grows with\nhis region, or goes backwards with it. He must take an\nactive part in everything that affects it.\nRepublicans to Hold\nMidwest Conference\nElk Point, S. D.\u2014A Republican\nmidwest farm conference to be de\nvoted to consideration of a long\nrange agricultural program, will be\nheld September 23 and 24 at Sioux\nCity, lowa, Axel J. Beck, Chairman\nof the Agricultural Subcommittee\nof the GOP National Committee,\nannounced here.\nThis conference has been called\nwith the approval of the members\nof the Agricultural Subcommittee\nand members of the Congressional\nadvisory group made up of Senators\nHough Butler of Nebraska and Mil\nton R. Young of North Dakota and\nRepresentatives Clifford R. Hope of\nKansas and August H. Andresen of\nMinnesota.\n\u201cAmong those who will attend\nthe conference,\u201d Mr. Beck said,\n\u201care Republican members of the\nAgricultural committees of the\nHouse and Senate, other Republi\ncan members of Congress from the\nmidwestern States and Republican\nGovernors in that area.\u201d\nThe important place on the pro\ngram will be given to leaders of\nthe various farm organizations, to\nthose who have done research in\nthe field and to dirt farmers. These\ngroups will be asked to give their\nviews and make recommendations\nto the conference.\n\u201cThis, with a background of re\nsearch, is to be a practical con\nference assigned to work toward a\nrealistic solution of agricultural\nproblems,\u201d Mr. Beck pointed out.\n\u201cThe dirt farmer will be urged to\ndiscuss the agricultural situation\nfrom the standpoint of men and\nwomen who actually operate the\nfarms.\u201d\nHeadquarters for the conference\nwill be in the Martin Hotel at Sioux\nCity.\nARIZONA SUN\nPhoenix Girl Wins\nSecond Place in Elks\nBeauty Contest\nDespite the popular applause of\nthousands and thousands of spec\ntators present at the Beauty\nPagaent last week, during the Elks\nNational Convention, held in San\nFrancisco, Miss Hazel Williams,\nwho represented the Elks of Ari\nzona, was nosed out of first place\nin competition with beauties all\nover the nation.

Take it to the garden\nfor gathering such things as beans, beets, tomatoes and kohlrabi. As\nthe vegetables are picked, shake the colander gently so that most\nof the dirt falls through the holes and stays in the garden. Then\nwhen the vegetables are brought to the kitchen, it\u2019s an easy trick\nto hold the colander under the faucet and wash away remaining\ndirt. The enameled colander has a smooth glass surface which is\ndurable and easy to keep clean.\nUSE\nBat Q'Uffi Point Co.\n\u201cTHE FRIENDLY STORE\u201d\n201 East Van Buren Phone 3-2108\nFRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1949\nLet the ARIZONA SUN\nbe your shooping guide.\nFOB RENT\nAPARTMENT\n(Men Only)\nMODERNLY EQUIPPED\nMiss Cecil Hewett\n316 W.

Certainly neither\nof these principles practiced exclusive\nly and constantly would produce our\nway of life. They serve as beneficial\ncheckmates on each other.\nSocialism embraces the practice of\nhaving many benefits accrue to the\ncitizens from the Federal Govern\nment. Those who oppose this form of\ngovernment are quick to point out\nthat through this method individual\ninitiative and private enterprise are\nchoked off and the recipients of the\ngovernment handouts are prone to be\ncome dependent upon a dole system.\nAlso they point out that these sup\nposedly gifts are not free but made\npossible through a high tax rate which\nis borne by the citizens. Various social\nsecurity aids and medical assistance\nand numerous other aids are fostered\nthrough Socialism.\nLiberalism permits a liberal inter\npretation of the constitution not lim\nited to the narrow literal meaning\nthereof. This, contends the liberal,\npermits the passage of legislation\nand other federal government action\nto meet the needs of the era in which\nwe live. It is progressive and opposed\nto Conservatism and distinguished\nfrom radicalism..\nConservatism proposes a ridid ad\nherence to the constitution as written,\npermitting only such actions to the\nfederal government as are specifically\nassigned to it in the constitution. Con\nservatism has rto capacity to help in\nthe guaranteeing of human rights, re\nserving no authority whatsoever for\nfederal government intervention into\nthe affairs of the individual states and\ntheir respective citizens. It is necessari\nly, as would appear from this attitude,\nunsympathetic towards the rights of\nminority groups.\nWe have not attempted a full treat\nise on the subject but rather covered\nthe pertinent aspects. Negro voters\nmust acquire a full knowledge of the\ncandidates for whom they vote in\ncluding their attitudes in respect to the\nsubjects we have discussed.

The\ntruth is that socialism simply extends the poverty, and every\nsave for the ever-growing bureaucracy that seems an in\none,\nescapable part of socialist governments, is ultimately the loser.\nThis is a perfectly logical course. Accumulated wealth,\nmuch as the agitators may denounce it, is the creator of jobs\nand opportunities for all. Invested savings built this country\nand its industries. Other nations have raw materials and\nnatural resources comparable to ours. But only in this nation,\nunder a system of government which was founded on the idea\nof guaranteeing a man the fruits of his initiative and success,\nhave those resources been given maximum development. In\ncentive, in other words, was responsible for the kind of progress\nthat brought the United States from a wilderness to the world's\nforemost industrial power in much less than two centuries.\nThe failure of socialism in England can be easily explained.\nThe policy of the Labor government is to rigidly restrict indi\nvidual economic advancement, to destroy established wealth,\nand to make all productive enterprise a function of the state.\nAll incentive has thus lost. The morass of red tape created\nby the government has made individual initiative impossible.!\n, ,. h .... . , .. ....\nEvery undertaking must lall within inelastic, unimaginative\nrules. And the result is that British industrial recovery has\nbeen disrupted.\nSocialism saps the vitality of peoples. It exalts mediocrity,\nIt turns nations into poor-houses.

Ever since its!\ninception, the TVA inception, the TVA has been subsidized at\nthe expense of every taxpayer. It has not paid a single cent\nin interest on the enormous amounts of money appropriated\nfor it. Yet the government, which provides the money, must!\npay interest to the bondholders who initially furnished it.\nEnemies of Forests\nOf all the elements destructive to\ntrees, fire is the worst, principally\nbecause it is the result of human\ncarelessness. Its direct damage\namounts to about 60 million dollars\nyearly in the forests of this country,\nbut since this total does not include\ndamage to tree seed, to loss in soil\nfertility, nor to the weakened con\ndition and less in merchandise vol\nume from trees that are not killed,\nthe total figure is many times that\namount.\nBut He Does Fall\nA man falls freely at about 118\nm.p.h., but with a standard para\nchute he falls at about 14 m.p.h.\n<x\n3\n<51\n/\nM\nmm\nw\n/\nShopa\n\u20aci\nThe Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts\nAll on a summer's day;\nThe Knave of Hearts devoured those tarts,\nIt happened just this way;\nQuoth he. \"Gadzooksl You Queen of Cooks,\nI\n'However do you do it?\"\nElectrified.'\nAnd she replied,\n\"There's really nothing to it, 1\n\"It's easy, slick, it's clean and quick,\"\n\"And costs so little.

Tribune)\nThe following was handed us some time ago and was\nneglected, but it is credited to the philosophy of Dr.\nAndy Hall of Mt. Vernon, Illinois, who at 85 sees the\ntrend and knows the remedy. He says: \u201cThere are only\ntwo places where socialism might work. One is heaven\nwhere socialism is not needed, and the other is hell\nwhere they already have socialism.\u201d\nHOOVER PROPOSAL CONDUCIVE TO PEACE\n(Somerset (Penna.) Daily American)\n. .. The Hoover proposal is for peace. Mr. Hoover does\nnot envision an organization that, by force of arms, may\nkeep the peace. Arms are not conductive to peace. What\nMr. Hoover has in mind is a world bory of free peoples\nbent upon making peace peacefully.\nBefore such a body, a militarily aggressive power\ncannot stand.\nLet us forget Mr. Roosevelt\u2019s idea that cuddling up\nto Russia will help the peace.\nLet us adopt the Hoover idea of reorganizing the Uni\nted Nations to leave Russia and those who hold views\ncoincident with her to discover their errors and, per\nhaps, adopt the civilization which the western nations\nseek to advance.\nGREEDY GOVERNMENT\nBy George Peck\nOur Federal Government consists of a grand total of\n533 people electe by popular vote (435 Representatives,\n96 Senators, 1 President and 1 Vice-President). Into\nthe hands of this small number of men and women, we,\nthe American people, place the power, among other\nthings, to tax us, to regulate us and keep us at peace or\nat war.\nThe fault of all governments (and ours is no excep\ntion) is that they ever seek to increase their powers.\nSeizing upon emergencies as pretexts (sometimes justi\nfiable, sometimes not), they add bureau after bureau,\nand put more and more people on the public payroll.\nThe worst feature of this procedure is that when the\nemergency (real or imaginary) has passed and there\ndefinitely no longer is need to continue these bureaus,\ngovernments do not close them up. All history reveals\nthat once'having seized any necessary powers, govern\nments cling tenaciously to them.\nThere is nothing strange about this\u2014it is simply hu\nman nature asserting itself. In the first place, politi\ncians thrive on power, and in the second, those who\nhave been added to the public payroll holler to high\nheaven if any attempt or threat of an attempt is made\nto ake them off. This creates a vicious circle in which\npoliticians are afraid of losing votes by releasing kov\nernment employees, and those employed demanding\nthat they be retained as Millstones around the necks of\nthe taxpayers.\nAt one time here in America, power was obtained by\nindividuals and groups through the organization of\nmoney. That is not true today. Money now is just as\nmuch as out of fashion as the bustle, and power comes\nthrough political position.\nThat government is best which rules the least, keeps\nthe number of employees on its payroll at a minimum,\nand pares its expenses to the bone. It naturally follows\nthat such a government, except in times of war, does\nnot have to levy back-breaking taxes. We had that kind\nof government here in America for a century and a half,\nup to a few years ago. We do not have such a govern\nment now.\n| News of the \\\\ orld\nAt A Glance \u2014\n(Continued from Page One)\ndents a landslide victory.

S.\nhas made available a total of $4O billion to keep\nBritain afloat.\u201d Was that Britain under today\u2019s\nLabor government, which though elected on a So\ncialist platform has in fact done little about estab\nlishing socialism?\nNo. The Labor party took power in 1945 and\nhas borrowed under $4 billion. The other $36 billion\nwent to an England run by sterling free enterprisers\n\u2014Prime Ministers Churchill, Chamberlain, Baldwin\nand Lloyd George. So socialism isn\u2019t the hole in\nEpstein\nBritania\u2019s stocking.\nWhat is? Barron\u2019s says frankly it\u2019s \u201cthe cost of power politics.\u201d\nFurthermore: \u201cIf the British don\u2019t keep armed forces in the places\n. . . considered strategically important, we\u2019ll have to spend our men,\nmoney and resources doing it ourselves . . . Thus, the extra invest\nment of S4O billion was well spent.\u201d\nStrategically important against whom? The Russians? Let\u2019s\nremember the date 1914. Twice since then Russia has been Britain\u2019s,\nand America's, ally in war. In between times, and partly during Ibe\nwars themselves, this expensive British power was used to boss the\nIndians, the Irish, etc. Now it\u2019s Palestine\u2014and oil. While it costs a\nlot, it brings fat returns\u2014to the corporations. Colonies, as everyone\nknows, mean cheaper raw materials and labor.\nThe British people voted for socialism to end that kind of spend\ning and start some on pork chops for the working man. That\u2019s no\nlonger a \u201cgood investment.\u201d Wall Street will advance money to Attlee\ntoday only if he forgets about it and concentrates on continuing the\npolicies of tory cabinets.\n* * *\nThe Wall Street Journal made this clear in its editorial of Aug. 13.\nNo more dough for England, it said, till \u201cthose who are unable to or\nganize British production turn the job over to those who can.\u201d Whom\never Englishmen voted for, they\u2019ve got to act like Churchill and She\nbig-business boys, or let Churchill back in. Otherwise no papa, no\nmama, no Uncle Sam.\nNow let\u2019s see how these policies look from the other side of the\ntracks, in Indonesia. A total of $350 million in U. S. money is set aside\nfor Holland, which is trying to reconquer that country. That is also the\nwish of Standard Oil, which has a half billion bucks invested there.\nWashington has offered \u201cgood offices\u201d to settle the fight. It told\nthe Indonesians it would arrange another talk with the Dutch, who\nhave their guns on the table. When Indonesia suggested that the State\nDept, arrange for United Nations arbitration, she was told to take the\noffer or leave it, that the UN could arbitrate only if Indonesia \u201cproved\u201d\nsovereignty.\n* * *\nHaji Salim, Indonesian foreign minister now in New York, said\non Aug. 18: \u201cWe are told to \u2022prove\u2019 our right to be free, in our own\nland, from the rule of people who live 10,000 miles away. Why should\nother nations, free themselves, ask for such proof?\nI hear the U. S. backs the Dutch. How can we believe then that\nyour government is ot. by and tor the people? If so. how can a people\nwhich fought for its own independence be represented by a policy that\nhelps the re-establishment of colonial powtr everywhere?\u201d\nThat policy, Mr. Salim, represents the corporations.

Brians os\nAll Aboard for Russia!\nAuthentic information now is\ncoming out of the Soviet Union,\nfrom behind the Iron Curtain,\ngiving striking evidence of the\ncomplete failure of Socialism\u2019s\nkey promise\u2014to provide a para\ndise for the wage earners. That\nwas Karl Marx\u2019s rallying cry and\nit has been the bait dangled be\nfore the wage earners by all So\ncialists in America and abroad\nsince Marx wrote his \u201cCommunist\nManifesto.\u201d\nSocialism\u2019s rosy promise to the\nwage earners, ironically, has failed\nmost miserably in Russia, the very\ncountry which holds itself up as\nthe perfect example of 100 per\ncent government ownership of the\ntools of production and distribu\ntion. And it has had 35 years of\ntrial and error in Russia, under\nthe most rigid application of pure\nSocialism, to prove its case.\nDocumented Facts\nAnxious to get some concrete\ndocumentation on the failure of\nthe Socialist economic system in\nRussia to raise the living stan\ndard of the wage earners, I wrote\nour State Department in Washing\nton, requesting authentic facts\nfrom behind the Iron Curtain.\nThey have supplied the facts,\nand the picture they paint of the\nworkers\u2019 plight under government\nownership of the production and\ndistribution facilities ought to\nconvince any American that So\ncialism is the worst possible way\nof life.\nThe Toilers\nIn 35 years finder government\n! ownership, here\u2019s what our State\nDepartment reports:\n\u201cSoviet workers have to put up\nj with whatever labor conditions\ntheir one and only employer (the\nj state) dictates. Wages are fixed\nSo are prices and working hours\n' Labor discipline is strict and any\nbreach of its numberless provi\nsions is severely punished. All\njobs are frozen. . . \u201d\nThe Payoff\nThe $64 question is: Has the\nj sweat and toil of the Soviet work\n! er, not to mention his loss of free\n| dom, been compensated by a bet\nj ter economic life, a higher stan\ndard of living? The answer is a\nbig NO!\nThere has been no improve\nment in the living standard since\nthe Socialist government took\nover all private property 35 years\nago. Today the Russian factory\nworker must work nearly an hour\nto earn enough to buy a pound oi\npotatoes. Under privately-owned\ncompetitive enterprise, the Amer\nican factory worker does it ir\ntwo minutes.\nAll food items present similar\ncomparisons. Housing is another\nexample. As many as three fam\nilies live in three- ,and four-roorr\nj houses or apartments in poverty\nWEATHER FORECAST\nCompiled by the\nU.S. Dept, of Commerce Weather Bureau\nMostly cloudy today and Satur\nday with light northeast winds.\nThe lowest temperature expec\nted tonight 0, highest Saturday 15.\nNome data last 24 hours as of\n7 a.m. today: High temperature\n22, low 4.

The clothes\nof the average Russian worker are\npitifully poor.\nState Not Withdrawing\nInstead of the state gradually\nwithering away, as Marx prom\nised, it gets more powerful and\nbrutal. A powerful bureaucratic\nclass has grown up. In it are sel\nected members of the 'Communist\nParty which numbers only 6,000,\n000 members. These rulers live\nrichly. The other 194,000,000 Rus\nsians are economic slaves. This is\nfull Socialism in practice \u2014 gov\nernment ownership. The facts\nshould alert all Americans, es\npecially wage earners, to resist\nfurther government encroachment\ninto the realm of production and\ndistribution. That is the road of\neconomic slavery.\nDAILY SCHEDULED FLIGHTS I\nTO SEATTLE AND PORTLAND I\n... , BB\nNOME TO FAIRBANKS BY WIEN\u2019S fll\nFAIRBANKS TO SEATTLE, PORTLAND BY ^B\nALASKA AIRLINES STARLINER ' flg\nNome\u2019s Only Daily Direct Service To The \u201cOutside\u201d\nI \u2014 -- . - \u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 \u2014...\nAlaska Development Held\nBack by Delay in Settling\nNatives\u2019 Claims to Land\nWASHINGTON, <tf> \u2014 Delay in\nsettling claims cff natives to land\nis retarding the development of\nAlaska, a House Insular Affairs\nsubcommittee was told Thursday.\nRep. D\u2019Eward (R-Mont) urged\nthe group to approve a bill pro\nviding for settlement of all claims\nto land.\nUnder the bill all claims would\nbe decided by the court of claims.\nThese could be presented by either\nindividuals or any community of\nIndians, Eskimos or other natives.\nCommissioner Dillon S. Myer\nof the Bureau of Indian Affairs\nsupported the bill. He said it\nshould b e definitely decided\nwhether the great majority of the\nland in Alaska is public lands or\nwhat, if any, rights the natives\nhave to it.\nHe proposes that m cases where\nthe Secretary of the Interior de\ntermines the native is incompe\ntent to handle his business affairs,\na restrictive patent fee should be\ngranted.\nThis would allow the depart\nment for not more than 20 years\nto protect the native, he said.\nMyer said that in the event oil\nor other minerals were discovered\nin Alaska this would help to pro\ntect the native against disposing\nof his land at a price far below\nits worth.\n!\n. . the letters start.

Newton\nEmployer -apposition to im\nprovements in Federal and State\nsocial insurance programs has\nled to ever-increasing pressure\nfrom workers to get the benefits\nthrough collective bargaining,\nUndersecretary of Labor Arthur\nLarson said last night.\nMr. Larson said that em\nployers have only themselves to\nblame for the situation through\neither outright opposition to or\nfailure to support governmental\nmoves designed to keep abreast\nof the times programs for work\nmen\u2019s compensation, social se\ncurity and unemployment com\npensation. \u2022\n\u201cThe time for a choice Is\nrapidly slipping away.\u201d Mr. Lar\nson told the Economic Club of\nChicago. He was dean of the\nUniversity of Pittsburgh Law\nSchool before his Labor Depart\nment appointment two months\nago.\nHe posed these questions to\nemployers: ,\n\u201cThe option that is being pre\nsented to us is this: Are we to\ndevelop and perfect our work\nmen\u2019s compensation, social se\ncurity and unemployment insur\nance to the point where they can\nperform in the best possible way\nthe functioh they were intended\nto perform?\n\"Or are we going to let them\ngradually wither away, doing\nrelatively less and less of the job,\nwhile privately negotiated sup\nplementary plans take over more\nand more of the functions these\nsystems were designed to fulfill?\u201d\nHe said \u201cEmployers cannot put\noff too long facing up to this\nquestion.\n\u201cWe are going to pay in one\nform or another for the conse\nquence of unemployment and dis\nability. We are not going to let\nthese people starve in the gut\nter.\u201d\nMr. Larson said opposition to\nsocial insurance is the result of\n\u201ca basic suspicion it is a form\nof socialism and a threat to our\nindividualistic American tradi\ntion.\u201d He said the suspicions\nwere unfounded and the pro\ngrams actually are \u201cinsurance\nagainst socialism.\u201d\n\u201cSocial Insurance,\u201d he said,\n\u2018 avoids the only alternative,\nwhich is relief and public as\nsistance, which, in my opinion,\nis the nearest thing to socialism\nwe have.\u201d\nMr. Larson said \u201cincomplete\nand inadequate\u201d social insur\nance programs are largely re\nsponsible for the $2.5 billion a\nyear relief and public assistance\nbill paid by the American public.\nHe said that despite a high\nrate of unemployment in recent,\nmonths \"business has remained\npretty good.\u201d He added that \u201ca\nlarge share of the credit for the\nfailure of this decline to turn\ninto* a spiral\u201d was due to un\nemployment compensation pay\nments to the workers who were\nlaid off.\nCrazed Man Shoots 3,\nKills Self in London\nBy th# Associated Press\nLONDON, May 19.\u2014A crazed\nman, seeking to wipe out a list of\nfancied enemies, shot three men\nin London's East End yesterday,\none fatally, then killed himself\nin a taxicab as police chased\nhim.\nThe gun wielder,\" a former\nIrish guardsman identified as\nNathan Goldberg, 27, plunged\ninto the taxi in a crowded the\nater district in an attempt to\nescape from a trained dog loosed\nby pursuing police.

Kenneth W* Sollitt\nThe oyster is endowed m th a ready-made house to live in*\nAll he has to do is open the doors of his house to take in\nhis food and close them again 'to keep out his enemiesf He\nhas perfect social security. Yet he is the easiest*fish in\n* the world to catch-, crush and cook. He always ends up in the\nsoup* So what does Ms vaunted security really amoupt to?\nThe eagle, on the other hand, is.peculiar among created'\nthings in another respect. vVhdn a severe storm strikes,\nother birds either hide from the storm or try to fight it as\n- long as their strength holds out; The eagle neither fights\nnor runs away. He simply sets his wings so the fury of thd\nstorm itself lifts him above the storm Yhere the sun is shin\n* ing, and there he remains, \"free as a bird,11 until the storm\n\u2018 is over. And only a* fool would pity the eagle because he\nisn1t an oyster.\nThe road to freedom in America must begin with.the de\ncision as to what kind of freedom we want* Is it freedom\nfrom something, or freedom for something?\nTo our forefathers, freedom meant the right to risk cap\nital in-the hope.' of return on their\u2018investments; the right\nof unlimited expansion of their business; the right to let\nthe people, in true democratic fashion, cast their ballots in\nthe cash registers ';of the nation for the businesses which\nserved them best. \u2018Freedom to them was a positive thing,- and\nthey wisely chose the*eagle as their national emblenf.'*'\nMore recently we have been indoctrinated with the nega- *\ntive idea that by \"freedom\" mean freedom from taking' risks\nand making our choices and decisions* This negative attitude\ntoward freedom exhibits itself in the very expressions we\nuse. Instead of freedom for life, liberty, and the pursuit\nof happiness, we speak of freedom from want, worry, and war\n(and Y/ork too, if possible). And we have been so busy flee\ning from these spectres * that we have turned a corner and run\niright into their arms. K.* ,...\nWe have sought freedom from fear so avidly that all it\nhas gotten us is a fear of freedom. We are fast becoming a\nnation of oysters. Instead of following the time-honored\ncustom of honest men and enjoying the freedom to work for,\nsave for, and buy the things we want, v/e have thought^that it\nwould be easier to elect men to Congress who would give us\nwhat we want at the expense of others.\nAna so our new. immoral ireeaom to raKe oy xaw Lnat, wnicn\nbelongs to another has destroyed the Old freedom to enjoy un\nmolested the fruits of our ingenuity and toil. First we must\ndecide which kind of freedom we want in the years ahead, the\nfreedom of parasites or the freedom of- noble men, the freedom\nof pirates or the freedom of honest persons.\nSecond, if:it.is-the freedom of honest persons that we\nhope to enjoy, we must resist all tendencies toward further\nsocialization, for socialism is piracy. Socialism is robbing *\nthe man who earns for the benefit of the one who doesn't, It\nis in ev*ry sense a system of the \"survival of the sickdst\"\nbecause it robs the ambitious 'of their initiative and keeps\nthe people who never had any initiative from developing any.\nSocialism has demonstrated four facts #ver and over\nagain: (1) You can11 multiply wealth by dividing it. (2)\nIt does no good to .get rid# of a few little monopolies by\ncreating a big. one called \"government.\" (3) The government\ncan't give what it does not first tajc^.awajr. (k) It ca*\nnever take away enough to supply* the ever increasing demands\nof those'who are led to believe they are getting something for\nnothing ^vhen they get it from Uncle Sam.\n(Cont, an Pago 5)\nJUNIOR-SENIOR play planned\nm HOMER STUDENTS\n'Try-outs for the Junior\nSehlor play f,Ghost Tails'1 of\n\u25a05 the, \u201e high school were\nheld last week, according to\nRichard Tylur, director.\nThe\u25a0T following students\n.. were , chosen to take partin\ntlmjplay ifthich will be pre\nsented to the public March 23;\nM%idlyn Aim, Bob Brovning,\nJoann Willard, Lee Browning,\nPat Donaldson, James Wicker\nsham,;, Linda Smith and Myrtle\nSibson. -*\nSupporting parts and the\nprompters will be handled by\nRon Elliott, Vic Bov/ers and\nGladys id throw.\nAccording to Tyler the\nplay is a comedy-mystery.\nLETTER TO THE EDITOR\nrDear Mr. Raver:\nInclosed please find $1\nfot airmail postage to sendny\nissue of The Kenai Peninsula\nPioneerVto the above address.\nThe floods have been dev\nF astating in this area but we\nwere fortunate in not having\nany trouble.\nI have temporaxy employ\nment here\" but we plan return\ning home early in the Spring.\nSave a little siow for us.\nSincerely,\nM. m.

But\nwe feel you should also get\na persona] report on the 1962\nHeart Fund and on our sew\nardship of the money en\ntrusted to us.\nFirst we want you to know\nthat Mississippians have in\nvested $178,956 in the 1962\nHeart Fund. It\u2019s gratifying\nto be able to tell you that\nMadison Countv has a $2,556\nstake in the 1962 Heart Fund,\nhaving topped its fair share\ngoal.\nNext, we\u2019re gratified to re\nport that nearly half of this\ntotal is again allocafed to re\nsearch and training which we\nbelieve is the most effective\nway to eradicate the heart\ndiseases which account for\nhalf of all deaths in this coun\ntry. We will account in full\nfor all heart association ex\npenditures, plans and pro\ngrams in the annual report we\nwill send you later this fall.\nPlease transmit to your staff\nthe appreciation of the Missis\nsippi Heart Association for\ntlieir interest in neipmg me\n136,000 heart disease suffer\ners in our state.\nSincerely,\nG.

Even the cas\nual observer must notice the\nimproved appearance of Mis\nsissippi\u2019s highways this sum\nmer, as compared with former\nyears.\nChairman Felder Dearman\nof the State Highway Com\nmission says it's true that the\nHighway Department has\nstepped up its litter campaign\nconsiderable. In addition to\nmere frequent roaside clean\nup. employees have been bom\nbarded with anti-litter infor\nmation; every Highway De\npartment vehicle has a litter\nmessage, and every piece of\nmail originating in the de\npartment carries a reminder\nto emphasize the waste and\nunsightly aspects of highway\nlitter.\nBut Dearman says most of\nthe big improvement has come\nabout as a result of public\nrecognition of the problem.\nCountless people have con\ntributed to this\u2014the Keep\nMississippi Beautiful Commit\ntee, press, radio and televis\nion, garden and civic clubs\nall over the state and many\nothers.\nIt costs money to pick un\nlitter on the highways\u2014big\nmoney.

R. Sullivan\nseated. \u201cRains came too late\nto help old cotton, but has\nhelped young cotton to con\ntinue to fruit.\n\u201cFarmers should make\nevery effort possible to save\nhnv. Johnson grass fields,\nsoybeans and other roughage\nto replace lack of corn.\u2019\u2019\nMr. Sullivan concluded by\nadvising farmers to begin\nbreaking land for winter graz\ning crops.\nWe would sincerely like to know,\nbeing puzzled all our life as to the, var\nious and sundry things at one time or\nanother labeled socialism. For more\nthan fifty years this writer has read\nand listened to exhortations against\nthe dangers and calamities that would\nbefall this nation if it did not turn\naway from socialistic tendencies.\nSo many things claimed to be tain\nted in socialism in those early days are\nnow taken as an integral part of our\ngovernment. The causes change, but\nthe cries never cease. Today, efforts\nare being made to raise the cry louder\nthan any previous time. And, if Social\nism does not scare enough it is fre\nquently linked with communism. Tn\nfact some people seem to hold to the\nnotion that the two are practically the\nsame.\nAll of this in spite of the fact that\nsome of the greatest plans and pro\ngrams this country has developed for\nthp benefit n-fi its citizens havp been la\nbeled socialistic and to some extent the\nlabel fits.\nSome of these, argued as being so\ncialistic at the time of adoption include\nsocial security, various welfare' and aid\nprograms, pension and retirement sys\ntems ami numerous protections and\nservices now made available to the poor\nwho once had nothing to look forward\ntq beyond their own feeble efforts.\nIt was said when Congressmen\nsent free seed to their constituents that\nthis was socialism. Today we have gov\nernment farm programs that make\nloans and allow payments and subsi\ndies for* almost every phase of agricul\nture. Of course, this comes under at\ntack, but no one well informed on the\nfarming situation seriously believes\nthat the government could get out of\nthe picture without complete collapse\nof agriculture.\nEven our state government has a\ncialism. Getting in, apparently, without\nany clear cut lines as to what is social\nism.\nA few hints are being thrown out\nas\u00bb to what promoters of this new wrin\nkle have in mind. We are told, and we\nquote, the purpose is to: \u201cHalt the\ntrend toward socialism of electric pow\ner, agriculture, housing and medicine\nwhich threaten to double the present\ncost of government service.\u201d\nIs the purpose of the new drive on\nsocialism to do away with the Rural\nElectrification program in Mississippi\nand elsewhere? Right here in Madison\nCounty and in all other counties of this\nstate we have hundreds of families en\njoying the benefits, conveniences and\neconomy of electric power that would\nnot be theirs today if left to develop\nment by the various power companies.\nAnd, every family, whether served\nfrom a REA or company power line,\npays far less for electrical energy be\ncause of TVA and REA programs.\nWhat about our own Canton municipal\nutilities? Most certainly they are as\nsocialistic as any of the others. Should\nwe cease and desist an undertaking\nthat has proven so highly successful?\nWe have already commented on\n:the impossibility to return agriculture\nto a( buyer and seller system, so we are\nJin the dark as to what the \u201ccrusaders\u201d\nhave in mind. We doubt if the propo\nnents of this new drive on socialism\nwould seriously advocate such a return\nwithout numerous reservations.\nAnd the housing stand is the most\ncurious of all. Two-thirds, perhaps\nmore, of all the homes that have been\nbuilt or bought for family living dur\ning the past decade have been financed\n'through government funds.

They\ndocked at London then went\nto Hull where the cargo was\nunloaded. A pleasant cruise\nwas enjoyed all the way until\nreaching the Azores, where\nthe weather was rough.\nThe ship they were on was\nloaded with lead, copper and\nlumber. The cotton ship pre\nceded them on the voyage.\nThey returned on the same\nship and docked at New Or\nleans*\nAbiaca Creek Emptying\nWater In Tchula Lake\nAn unprecedented rise of\nten feet in Tchula lake last\nweek was caused by Abiaca\ncreek emptying into it b>\nfirst flowing through a group\nof lakes and bayous in the\nnorthern part of the delta area\nof Holmes county.\nAccording t o supervisor\nJesse H. Walton, the Abiaca\nDrainage Canal above Cruger\nhas broken its banks, now\nflows through Clear lake,\nHunchback ilakq, Fish lake\nMud lake, Dollar lake and\nSpring branch, emptying into\nupper Tchula lake.

Impartial investigations\nand surveys have revealed a shocking\nneed for more medical and hospital\nservice than now available to the un\nfortunate. Are they td be denied?\nOnce you carefully consider what\nis actually behind this particular cru\nsade against socialism, it begins to lose\nsome of its lustre and in fact becomes\nsomewhat of a game \u201cpulling the other\nfellow\u2019s chestnuts out of the fire.\u201d\nOne does not havd to be a socialism\nenthusiast, and most certainly this\nwriter is not, to realize that many of\nthe government programs adopted in\nthe past have been for the benefit of\nthe people. Whether of a socialistic na\nture or not, they have become a part of\nour way of life and undoubtedly will\nendure.\nDo the crusaders want to abandon\nall of them or even part of them? Who\nis to decide what is good and what is\nbad about such programs? What does\nsocialism actually mean under our pre\nsent American system of government?\nIs it all bad? Should we abandon every\nthing that is slightly tainted with th\u20ac\nisocialism theory?\nYes, we would like to know.\ndopted various programs that would\nhave been labeled socialistic a few de\ncades back. We have a forestry bank\nvarious promotional and encourage\nment programs to which the govern\nment lends, support and contributes ca\npital. Our Balance Agriculture With In\ndustry program, which the whole state\nso enthusiastically supports, is social\nistic tinged in the eyes of many. We\nspend tax money to publicize our at\ntractions and to make things easy for\nmanufacturers who are seeking the\nfriendliest possible climate. We give\nnew industry tax exemptions at the ex\npense of those already established.\nAnd, in fact, our own homestead ex\nemption law must be classed as some\nwhat socialistic in nature.\nWe go even further. We build coli\nseums, football stadiums and other\nstructures in Jackson and elsewhere\nover the state for benefit of only part\nof the people but which are financed\nout of public money. We could go on\nand on and on about the numerous pro\ngrams we adopt and which wejcan not\nclearly disassociate from socialism.\nWhat we would like to know is\nwhether the people who are constantly\nharping on \u201ccreeping socialism\u201d want\nto do away with all the various pro\ngrams we now have and to prevent\nothers that may be proposed this de\ncade oi< thei nex,t.\nWe are h little amused and some\nwhat bemused by the latest develop\nment in our fair state, that of civic\nclubs getting into the fight against so\nFootball Practice\nBegins Monday For\nHolmes Bulldogs\nGOODMAN, Miss.

But we\nshould not become too scared over the word selected by reaction\nIn our political life.\nOur nation is spending billions in Europe for various pro\njects there has been billions spent in the past and there will\nbe billions spent in the future. The CIO has been a part of spon\nsoring legislation to help the hungry in Europe and this kind of\nhelp naturally means many dollars and cents out of the pockets\nof taxpayers.\nIt doesn\u2019t make any difference how much money is spent\nin Europe and Asia to sustain our effort in fighting communism\nno one so far as I have been able to find has labeled our aid and\nhelp to foreign countries as \u201csocialism.\u201d All of us have read\nthough, where there was an honest disagreement on procedure\nin our foreign aid, or that perhaps we were spending too much\nmoney for the results we or the world was getting in return.\nBut not one word about what we were doing was \u201csocialism.\u201d\nLately every measure that is brought forth to help the aver\nage citizen is labeled \u201csocialism\u201d and it seems consistent to me\ntnat if aid to Europe is not socialism then aid to our citizenry in\nthis country should be in the same predicament.\nAs we go deeper into this fall\u2019s campaign we will hear\nmore about the word \u201csocialism\u201d and if the reactionary politi\ncians, including Senator Taft, are successful in their campaign\nfor office undoubtedly the scare word will be carried over into\nthe national campaign in 1952.\nSocialism means the nationalization of industry. So far as\nI know no one of responsibility, in either the CIO and AFL, have\nadvocated the nationalization of our industries. In other words\nthe labor unions are not in favor of \u201csocialism.\u201d Neither the\nDemocratic or Republican party has advocated nationalization\nof industry.... think for yourself, who is advocating nationali\nsation?\nOne of the arguments used against President Truman about\nsocialism is the fact that he advocated the government build\nmore steel mills. But the President did this for a very good rea\nson .. the steel companies refused to expand their steel making\nfacilities and steel being a basis product their might have been\na continued steel shortage. As of now the steel companies are\nupending their facilities and we might be past that argument.\n14* Two outstanding examples of socialism in this country is\nour Post Office system and our roads. No sane person will advo\ncate that we turn these activities back to private interests.\nAid to Europe is essentially immediate aid to big business\nin this country. Corporate interests have a stake in the adminis\ntration of present aid as well as future aid to foreign countries.\nIf measures to help the workers and citizens are \u201csocialistic\u201d in\nthis country then American big business is up to it\u2019s neck in\n\u201csocialism\u201d in foreign and.\nA interesting feature of this whole argument about \u201csocial\nism\u201d it that anything that is done for those Americans in the\nlower-income group is \u201csocialism\u201d and I refuse to believe the\naverage voter will fall for this kind of argument. they cer\ntainly can see farther than the end of their nos^\nRed Cross\nDrive Now In\nfinal Week\nThe 1950 fpund campaign of\nToledo Chapter, American Na\ntional Red Cross enters the final\nweek of activity today with\nprospets good for over subcrip\ntion of the local goal of $260,040,\nacording to John Duncan, Jr.,\ndrive chairman.\n\u201cThe annual Red Cross cam\npaign\u201d is a true manifestation of\nof democracy\u201d, Mr. Duncan de\nclared.\nHe pointed out that the Red\nCross is under charter obligation\nto the Congress of the United\nStates yet raises its money by\nfree subscription.\nSpecifically, he asserted, the\nr-vd Cross is under charter obli\n4$ftion \u201cto furnish volunteer aid\nto the sick and wounded of\narmies in time of war. to per\nform all the duties devolved up\non a national society by each na\ntion which has acceded to the\nTreaty of Geneva... to at in\nmatters of voluntary relief and\nin accord with the military and\nnaval authorities as a medium\nof communication between the\npeople of the United States and\ntheir army and navy... to con\ntinue and carry on a system of\nnational and international relief\nin time of peace and apply the\nsame in mitigating the suffer\nings caused by pestilence, fam\nfle, fire, floods, and other great\nnational calamities, and to de\nvise and carry on measures for\npreventing them.\u201d\nHere in Toledo, a quota of\n$260,040, of a national goal of\n$67,000,000 has been assigned.\nToledo, as a community, is jeal\nous of its splendid record in Red\nCross campaigns. Not once since\ndrives began here in 191} have\nthe people of the Toledo area\nfailed to achieve their assigned\ngoal.\nNationally and locally the\nfunds are expended for disaster\nrelief, service to members of the\narmed forces, veterans and their\nfamilies, nursing services, Junior\nRed Cross in which 59,782 To\nledo school children are enroll\ned, safety, food and nutrition\nservices.\nThe core of the success of the\nRed Cross during war and peace\nis provided by volunteers who\nserve as staff aides, workers in\nprodution and supply, social\nwelfare welfare aides, canteen\nworkeres, motor service drivers\nnurse\u2019s aids and others. In Tole\ndo last year volunteers con\ntributed 20,686 hours of their\ntime to carry oik the work of the\nlocal chapter.\nPart of the money raised in\nthe Toledo campaign will be\nused for relief and rehabilitation\nin major catastrophes which\nmay occur in 1950. Part of it\nwill be spent in camps, stations,\nhospitals and garrisons for serv\nice to more than 1,500,000 arm\ned force members throughout\nthe world from service centers\nin Tokyo to canteens in Alaska.\nIndia, Greece, New Guinea and\nhundreds of other places where\nU.S. troops are stationed.\nGet Ready!\nBy RUTH TAYLOR\nTHE\nOTHER DAY I came\nacross a homely preverb\nthat was so pertinent I cut it\nout to mull over.

You\nknow these are the people who\nenjoy poor health, who seem\nto take a mournful pleasure\nin talking about how bad\nthings are. They get a sort of\ncheer out of seeing the dark\nside of things.

Now she\nwas not only giving trouble a\nchair to sit on but was spread\ning a feast for it. Her\u2019s was a\nvicious circle. She probably\nwasn\u2019t paid what she thought\na good job was worth, but un\nless she did a good job, it was\ncertain she wouldn\u2019t be paid\nat all! '-.O\u2019\nThere are fliose who face\nthe future by penny pinching\nbut at the same time squander\ndollars of time. Not that I\u2019m\ntalking against money in the\nbank. U. S.

But there is something\nmore needed.\nDon\u2019t forget that good health\nto face weather is better than\na silk umbrella. And that\nsound preparation by educa\ntion to earn a living is the\nbest insurance against econom\nic insecurity. The development\nof earning skill ia an assett in\nmore ways than one. The way\nto hold a job is to do that job\nbetter than anyone else can do\nit.\nI\nCertainly this period of\nworld insecurity is going to\nbe difficult for all of us, but\nwe needn\u2019t make it worse. We\ndon\u2019t have to offer trouble a\nchair. We can be ready to face\nanything by preparing for it\nand by making ourselves\ninvaluable in the job we now\nhold.\nIts Monroe At\nArena March 19\nSingers, dancers and comedi\nans are not the only solo talents\nwho get the spotlight with the\nVaughn Monroe 35-strong enter\ntainment unit, which will ap\npear at the Toledo Sports Arena\non Sunday, March 19.

He made his fjrst pub\nlic appearance at 7 as soloist\nwith the symphony orchestra in\nKingston, New York \u2014playing\nthe Mozart Major violin con\ncerto. In 1929 he gave the first\nof four violin recitals in New\nYork\u2019s famous Town Hall, and\nbetween then and the beginning\nof fiis association with the Mon\nroe organization he was for sev\neral years concert master for the\nNew Orleans Symphony and\nlater the Ballet Russe.\nEarle graduated from Albany,\nNew York, High School later\nattending New York University\nfor three years. His best efforts\nin school were directed along the\nlines of mathematics, and his\nspare time activities also reflect\nthe same turn of mind. He is an\nexpert chess and bridge player,\nhaving been a Class A chess\nchamp of New York State once,\nand a state team bridge cham\npion twice.\nAs a boy he played a great\ndeal of tennis and remembers\nharboring dreams of becoming\na member of the Davis Cup\nTeam. His father had quite dif\nferent ideas, however. \u201cDad\nmade me practice my violin,\u201d\nrecalls Earle. \u201cIn the light of the\nsuccess and happiness I\u2019ve reap\ned from all that practicing, I\ncan\u2019t say I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nTWUA-CIO Seeks\n94c Wage Floor\nNEW YORK (LPA) \u2014A\neent-an-hour minimum\nOn Febru\u00ad\nwage\nLor workers on government con\ntracts in the cotton-rayon indus\ntry has been requested by Tex\ntile Workers of America-CIO.\nCurrent minimum under gov\nernment contracts is 87 cents.\nCoing rate in the industry is\nnow 97 cents in the north -and\n94 cents in the south.\nFINE WATCH REPAIRING\nLOWEST PRICES\nTOLEDO UNION JOU1NAL\n\u201cTH!

Many roll\ncalls and the use of parlia\nmentary procedure that had\nbeen in mothballs for over a\ncentury held off general de\nbate on the bill until 5 p. m.\nTom Burke\nThia read-\nAt almost 4 a. m., the fol\nlowing morning, after 16\nhours of continuous session,\nthe House accepted the Mc\nConnell substitute for the bill\nthat had been presented by\nthe House Committee on Edu\ncation and Labor. Weak as\nthat substitute was in its orig\ninal form, its many amend\nments made it an absolute\ntravesty and mockery of Le\ngislation.\nLike the Taft-Hartley Act,\nthis legislation sets forth the\nprinciple that people have cer\ntain natural and constitutional\nrights and that they must be\nprotected in the free exercise\nof these rights and then pro\nvides, in a great number of\nwords, absolutely nothing in,\nthe way of protection.\nJOB\nsituation, frankly, Is\ngloomy.\nGovernment reports show\nunemployment at highest fig\nure\u20144,684,000 men and wom\nen since August 1941. That\nfigure, for month of February,\nshowed a 200,000 increase\nover January.\nThat figure doesn\u2019t include\nsome' million people working\nless than 35 hours a week.\nAt end of war, America\nwas talking about providing\n\u201c60 million jobs.\u201d\nWe\u2019re three million short of\nthat goal today. If we had\n60 mililon jobs in early 1950,\nunemployment would be no\nproblem.\nBut fact remains that un\nemployment is steadily, aeri\noutly becoming dangerous not\nonly for millions of workers\ninvolved, but for whole Amer\nican economy. Almost without\nlet-up, jobless figure has been\ngrowing thousand-by-thousand\nfor more than a year.\nCIO pretty accurately pre\ndicted situation last year. CIO\nFull Employment Committee,\nin report to recent Executive\nBoard, saw no reason for rose\ncolored glasses: \u201cOutlook for\n1950 is for further decline\nas unemployment is rising, in\ncome is dipping and the gen\neral picture is one of easing\naway from full employment.\u201d\nCIO officials are in fre\nquent discussion with govern\nment economists and admin\nistration officials over prob\nlem. CIO has proposed num\nber of steps to improve coun\ntry\u2019s economic health\u2014and to\ngive extra help to those now\njobless but so far Congress\nhasn\u2019t done anything about it.\nBut there\u2019s not too much\ntime for further stalling.\nOne of most alert state ad\nministrations to jobless prob\nlem is that of Governor Ches\nter Bowles in Connecticut.\nBowles, as OPA head, fought\nprofit-gougers who helped get\nus into present economic mess.\nNow, as governor of a hard\nhit- industrial state, Bowles\nhas set up a statewide Full\nEmployment Committee.\nCommittee\u2019s job will be to\ndevelop broad program of\n\u201ceconomic expansion\u201d, as\nmeans of creating new jobs\nand of lifting industrial out\nput, retail sales and farm in\ncome.\nOne by one? unions get hit\nin face by vicious provisions\nof Taft-Hartley.\nThis time, its maritime\nworkers\u2019 organizations\u2014which\nface disruption of entire\n94\nPRINCESS!*\n3rd Big Week\n\u2022SAMSON\nand\nYour Congressman Reports\nGreat bundles of cards, urg\nIng repeal of the theater tax\nand signed by movie-goers,\nare being sent to this office\nby Toledo theater operators*\nI am quite willing to suppori\nrepeal of this excise tax, pro\nviding we have some assure\nance from theater operators\nthat the amount of the tax\nactually will be dropped from\nthe price of admission should\njhe tax be repealed.\nOne of the reasons I am\nsupporting repeal of other ex*\nelse taxes is that I believe the\nrevenue lost by the repeal will\nbe more than made up in in\ncome taxes, because' business\nwill be increased and employ\nment will rise in the indus\ntries affected, once the tax is\nlifted.\nIn the case of the theaters,\nunless the amount of the tax\nis deducted from the full\namount which the patron now\npays at the box office, he still\nwill have no incentive to in\ncrease his patronage and the\ntheater business will remain\nstatic or even decline. I think\nthe theater-going public\nshould demand this assurance\nfrom theater owners and op\nerators.\nProgress on Federal Aid to\nEducation is slow.

They\u2019re seek\ning quick passage of Magnu\nson-Lesinski bill, which would\nclearly legalize hiring halls.\nIf bills don\u2019t pass, there\u2019s\ntrouble ahead on nation\u2019s\nwaterfronts.

It is \u201cConservative Socialism\" which is\nthe dominant trend among us now.\n\u201cPlanning\" owes its popularity largely to the fact that\neverybody desires, of course, that we should handle our com\nmon problems with as much foresight as possible.\nThe dispute between the modern planners and the liberals\nis NOT on whether we ought to employ systematic thinking\nin planning our affairs. It is a dispute about what is the\nBEST WAY of so doing.\nThe question is whether we should create conditions\nunder which the knowledge and initiative of individuals are\ngiven the best scope so that THEY can plan most successfully;\nor whether we should direct and organize all economic activi\nties according to a \u201cblueprint,\" that is \u201cconsciously direct the\nresources of society to conform to the planners' particular\nviews of who should have what.\"\nIt is important not to confuse opposition against the latter\nkind of planning with a dogmatic laissez faire attitude.\n-Ay\u2014 ye #\nTHE liberal argument does not advocate leaving things just\nas they are; it favors making the BEST POSSIBLE USE\nOF THE FORCES OF COMPETITION as a means of co-ordi\nnating human efforts.\nIs is based on the conviction that, where effective\ncompetition can be created, if is a better way of guid\ning individual efforts than any other.\nIt emphasizes that in order to make competition\nwork beneficially a carefully thought-out legal frame\nwork is required, and that neither the past nor the\nexisting legal rules are free from grave defects.\n# * #\nLIBERALISM is opposed, however, to supplanting competi\ntion by inferior methods of guiding economic activity.\nAnd it regards competition as superior not only because in\nmost circumstances it is the most efficient method known but\nbecause IT IS THE ONLY METHOD WHICH DOES NOT\nREQUIRE THE COERCIVE OR ARBITRARY INTERVEN\nTION OF AUTHORITY.\nIt dispenses with the nred for \u201c con sci oinTTIOC ia I control\"\nand gives individuals a chance to deride whether the prospects\nof a particular occupation are sufficient tn compensate for the\ndisadvantages connected with it-\nThe successful use of competition does not preclude some\ntypes of government interference. For instance, to limit work\ning hours, to require certain sanitary arrangements, to pro\nvide an extensive system of social services is fully compatible\nwith the preservation of competition.\nThere are, too. certain fields where the system of com\npetition is impracticatle.\nFor example, the harmful effects of deforestation or of\nsmoke of factories cannot be confined to the owner of the\nproperty in question. But the fact that we have to resort to\ndirect regulation by authority where the conditions for the\nproper working of competition cannot be created DOES NOT\nPROVE that we should SUPPRESS competition where it can\nbe made to function.\nTo create conditions in which competition will he\nas effective as possible, to prevent fraud and deception,\nto break up monopolies\u2014these tasks provide a wide\nand unquestioned field for state activity.\n+ * >\nrpHIS does not mean that it is possible to find *ome ' middle\n1 way\" between competition and central direction, though\nnothing seems at first more plausible, or is more likely to\nappeal to reasonable people.\nsense proves a treacherous guide in this\nfield. Although competition can bear some admixture of regu\nlation. it CANNOT RE COMBINED WITH PLANNING TO\nANY EXTENT WE LIKE WITHOUT CEASING TO OPER\nATE AS AN EFFECTIVE GUIDE TO PRODUCTION.\nRoth competition and central direction become poor and\ninefficient tools if they are incomplete, and a mixture of the\ntwo means that neither will w\u2019nrk.\nPlanning and competition can be combined only by plan\nning FOR competition, not by planning AGAINST competition.\nThe planning against which all our criticism is directed is\nsolely against competition.\nThe Greet Utopia\nThere can be no doubt that most of those in the democ\nracies who demand a central direction of all economic activity\nstill believe that a socialism and individual freedom can be\ncombined. YET SOCIALISM WAS EARLY RECOGNIZED\nBY MANY THINKERS AS THE GRAVEST THREAT TO\nFREEDOM.\nIt is rarely remembered now that socialism in its\nbeginning was frankly authoritarian. It began quite\nopenly as a reaction against the liberalism of the\nFrench revolution. The French writers who laid its\nfoundation had no doubt that their ideas could be put\ninto practice only by a strong dictatorial government.\nThe first of modern planners, Saint-Simon, predicted\nthat those who did not obey his proposed planning\nboards would be \u201ctreated as cattle\n# \u00ab \u00bb\nNORODY saw more clearly than the great political thinker,\nDe Tocque-oville, that democracy stands in an irrecon\ncilable conflict with socialism:\n\u201cDemocracy extends the sphere of indixidual freedom.\" he\nsaid. \u201cDemocracy attaches all possible \\alue to each man,\" he\nsaid in 184 K. \u201cwhile socialism makes each man a mere agent,\na mere number. Democracy and socialism ha\\e nothing in\ncommon but one word: equality. But notice the difference;\nWhile democracy seeks EQUALITY in LIBERTY, socialism\nseeks equality in RESTRAINT AND SERVITUDE.\"\nTo allay these suspicions and to harness to its cart the\nstrongest of all political motives\u2014the craving for freedom\nSocialists began increasingly to make use of the promise of a\n\u201cnew\u2019 freedom.\" Socialism was to bring \u201ceconomic freedom,\"\nwithout which political freedom was \u201cnot worth having.\"\nTo make this argument sound plausible, the word \u201cfree\ndom\" was subjected to a subtle change in meaning.\nThe word has formerly meant freedom from coercion,\nfrom the arbitrary power of other men. Now\u2019 it was made to\nmean freedom from necessity, release from the compulsion of\nthe circumstances which inevitably limit the range of choice\nof all of us.\nFreedom in this sense is, of course, merely another\nname for power or wealth. The demand for the new\nfreedom was thus only another name for the old de\nmand for a redistribution of wealth.\nThe claim that a planned economy would produce a sub\nstantially larger output than the competitive system is being\nprogressively abandoned bv moat students of the problem.\nYET IT IS THIS FALSE HOPE AS MUCH AS ANYTHING\nWHICH DRIVES US ALONG THE ROAD TO PLANNING,\n\u2666 * #\nALTHOUGH our modern Socialists\u2019 promise of greater free\ndon\u00bbis genuine and sincere, in recent years observer after\nobserver has been impressed by the unforeseen consequences\nof socialism, the extraordinary similarity in many respects of\nthe conditions under \u2018\u2018communism\u2019\u2019 and \u201cfascism.\u201d\nAs the writer Peter Drucker expressed it in 1939:\n\u201cThe complete collapse of the belief in the attainability\nand equality through Marxism has forced Russia to travel the\nsame road toward a totalitarian society of unfreedom and\ninequality which Germany has been following. Not that com\nmunism and fascism are essentially the same. Fascism is the\nstage reached after communism has proved an illusion, and It\nhas proved as much an illusian in Russia as in pre-Hitler Ger\nmany.**\nNo less significant is the intellectual outlook of the ranjc\nand file in the Communist an(f Fascist movements in Germany\nbefore 1933. The relative ease with which a young Communist\nCOULD BE CONVERTED into a Nazi or vice versa was well\nknown, best of all to the propagandists of the tw-o parties.\nThe Communists and Nazis clashed more frequently with\neach other than with other parties simply because they com\npeted for the same types of mind and reserved for each other\nthe hatred of the heretic.\nTheir practice showed how closely they are related. To\nboth, the real enemy, the man with whom they had nothing in\nrommon, was the liberal of the old type.\nWhile to the Nazi the Communist and to the Communist\nthe Nazi, and to both the Socialist, are POTENTIAL RE\nCRUITS made of the right timber, they both know that\nTHERE CAN BE NO COMPROMISE BETWEEN THEM AND\nTHOSE WHO REALLY BELIEVE IN INDIVIDUAL FREE\nDOM.\n_\u2666 .... # * '\nWHAT is promised to us as the road to freedom is in faet\nthe high road to servitude. For it is not difficult to see\nwhat must he the consequeneps when democracy embarks upon\na course of planning.\nThe goal of the planning will he described by some surfc\nvague term as \u201cthe general welfare.\u201d\nThere will be no real agreement as to the ends to\nhe attained, and the effect of the people\u2019s agreeing\nthat there must be central planning, without agreeing\non the ends, will be rather as if a group of people were\nto commit themselves to take a journey together\nWITHOUT AGREEING WHERE THEY WANT TO\nGO: with the result that they may all have to make a\njourney which most of them do not want at all.\nDemocratic assemblies cannot function as planning agen\ncies. They cannot produce agreement on everything the whnl*\ndirection of the resources of the nation- FOR THE NUMBER\nOF POSSIBLE COURSES OF ACTION WILL BE LEGION.\nEven if a Congress could. by proeeerling step by step and\ncompromising a* each point . agree on some scht rr.e it would\ncertainly in the end SATISFY Nobody.\nTo draw up an economic plan in this fashion is even less\npossible than, for instance, successfully to plan a military\ncampaign by democratic procedure.\nAs in strategy it would become inevitable to delegate the\ntask to experts. And even if. by this expedient, a democracy\nshould succeed in planning every sector of economic activity,\nit would still have to face the problem of integrating these\nseparate plans into a unitary whole.\nThere will he a stronger and stronger demand that some\nhoard or some single individual should be given powers to act\non their own responsibility.\nTHE CRY FOR AN ECONOMIC DICTATOR IS A CHAR\nACTERISTIC STAGE IN THE MOVEMENT TOWARD\nPLANNING.\nriIHUS the legislative hodv will he reduced to choosing the\n1 persons who are to have practically absolute power\nThe whole system will tend toward tha* kind of dictator\nship in w hich the heed of the g ent it fr< m tim< J fime\nconfirmed in ins position by popu ir vote, but where HE HAS\nALL THE POWERS AT HIS COMMAND TO MAKE CER\nTAIN THAT THE VOTE WILL GO IN THE DIRECTION HE\nDESIRES.\nPlanning leads to dictatorship because dictator\nship is the most effective instrument of coercion and,\nas such, essential if central planning on a large scale\nis to be possible.\nThere is no justification for the widespread belief that, so\nlong as power is conferred by democratic procedure, it cannot\nbe arbitrary; it is not the source of power which prevents it\nfrom being arbitrary: to he free from dictatorial qualities, the\npower must also be limited.\n(To Be Continued)\nLetters to Loitoii\nTO THE EDITOR:\nI HAVE been deeply gratified\n* by the attention newspapers\nJ have given to ihe treasury\u2019s\ndrive against lax evader-\nThis letter is to thank you for i\n! this attention, and to urge a\n] continuing interest.\nAn attempted evasion of in\ncome lax in anv yeai cannot be\n; discovered until afier returns j\nhave been filed in the next year.\nAnd in developing a case for i\nprosecution, it is necessary to I\ntrace income in excess of ihat\nreported.

After listing the\nArab violations, the Foreign Of\nfice asked the mediator what he\nintends to do about them.\nSpecifically, the Israelis said\nthat large quanities of arms and\nammunition were recently un\nloaded in the Iraq port of Basra\nand distributed from there\nthroughout the Middle East.\nOther military shipments have\nbeen discharged at Beirut, ap\nparently on consignment for the\nArab Legion. In addition the Is\nraeli protest declared there is a\ndaily arms traffic between Beirut\nand Transjordan.\no\nIsrael Worried\n(Continued from page 1)\ntions, as well as the granting of\nfinancial assistance, depend on Is\nrael\u2019s surrender of the Negev.\nFaris el Kroury, Syrian dele\ngate to the U.N., has approached\nthe Russians to feel out what\nchances exist for a rapproache\nment between the Arabs and the\nSoviets. Although the Russians\nare reported t o welcome the\nArabs\u2019 opposition to Bernadotte\u2019s\nreport, Yaacov Malik, envoy to\nthe U.N., told the Syrian delegate\nthat Soviet policy on Palestine is\nstill based on the premise that the\nNov. 29 General Assembly Pale\nstine partition resolution must be\nimplemented.\nActing mediator Dr. Ralph\nBunche this week gave full sup\nport to the recommendations of\nthe late mediator, Count Folke\nBernadotte, for settling the Pale\nstine problem by exchanging the\nNegev for Western Galilee, estab\nlishing Haifa add Lydda as free\nsea and air ports, respectively,\nand internationalizing Jerusalem.\nKeep Negev\n(Continued from page 1)\ndeposits of the Dead Sea, he\nstated. Those minerals, Rabbi Sil\nver added, constitute perhaps the\nonly reserve of valuable minerals\navailable to Israel and the \u201cbasis\nof a varied and highly skilled\nchemical industry.\u201d Loss of the\narea would also deprive Israel of\nthe possible use of a port at Aka\nba on the Red Sea and the likely\npossibility of oil deposits. The\nlatter is \u201cperhaps the real reason\nwhy it is now proposed to take\nthis territory away from Israel\nand hand it over to a puppet of\nBritain,\u201d he asserted.\nTurning to the proposed inter\nnationalization of Jerusalem,\nRabbi Silver said that the Jews\noriginally agreed to such a pro\nposal on the assumption that the\nArabs would respect U.N. control\nof the city and not molest its 90,-\n000 Jewish inhabitants. However,\nsubsequent developments have\nproved that the Arabs do not in\ntend to permit the U.N. to main\ntain Jerusalem as an international\ncity.\n\u201cIt is inconceivable- that the\nJews of Jerusalem and Israel will\never again consent to leave Jeru\nsalem in the midst of a hostile\nArab sea, unconnected with Is\nrael, and with no greater security\nfor their lives and property than\nwould be involved in the nominal\n\u2018control\u2019 of the United Nations,\u201d\nNow Is The Time\nto get\n\"A Notion Is Born\"\nHEAR ISRAEL'S first President, Dr\nChaim Weizmann; Moshe Shertok,\nISRAEL'S first Foreign Minister;\nDavid Ben-Gurion, Rabbi Dr. Abba\nHillel Silver, and other actual voices\nof Jewish and world leaders.

In the two years\nsince the war only 6,500 permanent\ndwellings had been completed as of\nOctober 1947, but the government\nhoped that 1948 would find 35,000\nmore ready for occupancy. Paradox\nically, the Labor government which\nadvocates socialism, some months\nback agreed to put building back into\nthe hands of private builders. Jacob\nKielland, housing director, said this\npolicy was initiated because, the gov\nernment feels labor can be bought\nmore cheaply by private contractors\nthan by the government. Building\ncosts have soared 150 per cent since\n1940, there is Black Market in ma\nterials and labor, the director said.\nBy a system of subsidies, wage\nregulation and price control, the gov\nernment has held the cost of living\nto a 60 per cent increase over 1938\n(as compared with 1,260 per cent in\nFrance since 1944).\nMost Money Used for Food\nThis figure does not tell the whole\nstory, however.

They put in 48-hour\nweeks at the factories, for a top wage\nof slightly under 60 cents an hour;\norganized farm workers, of whom\nthere are only 10,000, work 51-hour\nweeks, draw $17 a week and a house\nand fuel.\nTheir inability to provide ade\nquately for their children will, in the j\nlong run, have an adverse effect on I\npopulation.

This is only because the\npeople are not being told the truth about it.\nThe Communists believe that the ills of modern so\nciety stem not from weaknesses in human nature, but\nfrom the monopoly ownership of our industrial wealth\n\u25a0 1\n1\nby a handful of multi-millionaires and\nbillionaires who exercise autocratic power\ngreater than the kings of old.\nWhile supporting every progressive\nmeasure which can in any way benefit\nthe people under our present capitalist\nsystem, the Communists are firmly con\nvinced that the only basic remedy for re\ncurring depressions and wars, for unemployment and\ninequality, is the public ownership and operation of the\ngreat industries of our nation under a government of the\ncommon people, led by Labor.\nUnder such a government and such public ownership,\nproduction would be for use instead of profit, the eco\nnomic life of the nation would be planned, unemploy\nment and insecurity abolished and the basic cause of\nwar eliminated.\nThe Communists are convinced that such a system\u2014\nSocialism, will some day be established by the American\npeople, by their own free will and by majority action.\nWhile advocating the need for Socialism, the Communists\ndo not seek to impose their views upon their fellow citi\nzens. They have always and will always be ready to\naccept the democratic verdict of the majority.\nTo sum it up in a few words, Communists are staunch\nadvocates of government \u201cof, by and for the people\u201d.\nThey believe in Freedom\u2014freedom of speech, of the press,\nof worship, and also, freedom from want, insecurity, dis\ncrimination and war.\ndominate something like a\ndictator.

But there is no question about the fact\nthat private flying is going to expand rapidly in the\nnear future and that one of the big fields for small\nplanes is going to be their use by industry. Already aj\nnumber of industrial organizations own ships and use\nthem to save time for their executives who must travel\nlong distances between plants or to conventions cind\nthe like. This use of non-commercial planes is and will\ncontinue to be a solid backlog for aircraft manufactur\ners. It does not depend upon thrill seekers, but rather\nupon the inherent values of aviation itself.\nIn the June issue of Scientific American Dr. A1-'\nexander Klemin gives essential and pertinent facts\nabout personal planes. Dr. Klemin is writing a series\nof articles for this magazine which will take up other\naspects of private flying so that the average person may\ngain a complete and unbiased view of the advantages\nand disadvantages of this most modern \"form of trans\nportation. \u2022\n(Scientific American)\nI\nWOOD FACES TROUBLE '\nOFTEN DEALT with in the pages of Scientific Amer\nican have been the various aspects of wood pro\nduction and use. Right now it appears that wood faces\na two-forked impasse. First is the all too familiar cost\nof production versus price control. But in the long\nview this must be considered as a passing phase. Far\nmore important is the second fork: Growth. In 1945,\nfor example, almost twice as many board-feet of lum\nber were cut from American forests as were grown.\nObviously such a situation cannot continue for very\nlong. Of course, the wood industry in general is com\npletely familiar with the facts of the case and is doing\nsomething about it. But what is being done is not by\nany means enough. More industrialists must realize\nthe importance of wood in our national economy, and\nadd their strength to adequate plans for the restora\ntion and perpetuation of our forest resources.\nAbove all, wood must not be thought of simply in\nterms of lumber. Wood offers a vast storehouse of raw\nmaterials for a number of industries other than those\nconcerned with building materials. Pulp and paper\ncome next to mind, but then there are such diversifi\ncations as textiles and textile sizings, plastics, dyes,\ninsect repellants, perfumes, resins, essential oils, gums,\nalcohols, sugar, and a thousand and one other materials\nfor the chemical and allied industries.\nFaced with even this abbreviated list of wood pro\nducts, the problem looms large. Our forest lands are\nfar from producing their maximum yield. Our research\nlaboratories have only scratched the surface of the po\ntentialities of wood. Our forests can and must become\nour largest source of raw materials for the greatest\nnumber of industries. But they can reach the goal only\nby intelligent application of scientific principles of ad-i\n_\u2022_I\nI\nequate reforestation.\nThis subject of reforestation is one that has been\nbandied about for generations. Now the limit is ap\nproached. An understanding has been reached of the\nimportance of the forests of the United States, but all\ntoo little has been done about it. Many industries, old\nand new, depend on wood. If for no other reason than\nfor their contribution to these industries, the forests\nof the nation must be put in shape for maximum pro\nductivity.\n(Scientific American)\nHIS WEIGHT IN DIAMONDS\nTHE MOGUL rulers of India received tribute equal\nto their weight in gold. The Aga Khan, who is not\na secular ruler at all and who weighs 243 pounds and\n8 ounces, went them one better recently in Bombay\u2014\nhe received his weight in diamonds, to the reported\nvalue of $2,200,000. If the Aga Khan wished to do so\nhe could keep this money for himself. Having other\nmeans of his own, he will employ it to help members\nof the Ismaili sect of Mohammedism, of which he is\nthe spiritual head. His other means, which are believed\nto be stupendous, come from the voluntary contribu\ntions of millions of his followers.\nThe Aga Khan is a prince above princes. His bi\nography in the British Who\u2019s Who lists his honorary\ndegree from Cambridge, his British honors and decor\nations, his chairmanship of the Indian Round Table\nDelegation of 1930 and 1931, his presidency of the\nLeague of Nations Assembly in 1937, his victories in\nthe Derby, his eleven-gun salute and, almost incident\nally, his religious role. He is, in fact, a descendant of\nFatima, the daughter of Mohammed, and as such is\nbelieved by his followers to have divine attributes.\nThese are not visible to Western eyes. Indeed, he does\nnot parade them for the benefit of his cosmopolitan\nfriends. On the worldly scale he is a character with\ntwo phases: an Indian leader who has tried to unite\nIndia\u2019s Moslems, and has done a good deal for the ec\nonomic welfare of his Indian followers, many of them\nconverted Hindus; and an international playboy of a\ntype not so common as it used to be.\n# Indians who are not getting enough to eat now and\nwho face the prospect of considerably less if the\nthreatened famine is not averted by large imports of\nforeign grain might wonder a little about the Aga\nKhan\u2019s spiritual qualities. But one of his greetings on\nthe occasion of his anniversary celebration came from\nMahatha Gandhi.\n(New York Times)\n\\LooKrmr\nI AJStJSAD\nFw GEORGE Si BENSON\n^k Fraldtit\u2014MsfOaf M|v'\nUNDULANT SOCIALISM\nA sick republic, like a human\ninvalid, passes through a criiTs\nin the course of any protracted\nillness.

That was\nthe largest gain of any party. The communists suffered\nthe greatest loss, dropping from 91 to 29 seats.\nLet\u2019s Get This Straight\nThe remark of a fellow American, hearing that the\nsocialists have held power in Sweden since 1932, is worth\npassing on. \u201cOh my, I thought Sweden was a democracy!\u201d\nSo little distinction is made between socialism and com\nmunism here in America that we are in danger of over\nlooking the very conflicting aspects of both ideologies.\nWe are surprised to find that such a highly competent\nforeign correspondent as G. Howard Smith, representing\none of the outstanding newspapers of the country, should\nbe afflicted with a touch of this sort of political analpha\nbetism, or is he misinformed? In a recent Stockholm dis\npatch he writes: \u201c . . . Scandinavian social democracy is\ngrounded in Marist doctrine. Right up to the Russian\nputsch in Czechoslovakia in 1948 Scandinavian socialists\nhad tended to hold up the Soviet Union as a model\u2014at any\nrate, compared with the United States. To swing free from\nthis attitude has not been easy\u2014especially since the di\nviding line between socialism and communism is so blurred\nboth politically and within the labor unions.\u201d\nThis writer worked in the Scandinavian press both dur\ning and after the last war. If anything was made perfectly\nclear, after experience with three social-democratic news\npapers and leaders, it certainly was this: The social-demo\ncrats definitely did not hold up the Soviet Union as a\nmodel. The fact that the communists did was one of the\nunderlying causes for conflict between these two rival\ngroups. V\nScandinavian social democracy is grounded in Marxist\ndoctrine in a sense Smith does not seem to imply. It is\nindebted to Marx mainly with regard to his analysis of\ncapitalism, which, indeed, is a masterpiece of shrew in\nsight. But it embraces only a very liberal (and vastly re\nvised) portion of that broad program he prescribed for\nabolishing so-called capitalist injustices and evils and it\ncertainly doesn't follow his pattern for constructing a com\nmunist society.\nIs the dividing line really so blurred as Smith says?\nNo. The social-democrats (or socialistS\u2018as they are often\ncalled in this country) now in power in the Scandinavian\ncountries have long ago adopted a midle-of\u2014the-road pol\nicy, much more so than the socialists in Britain. The moral\nhas been and still is: experience shall at all times prove.\nthe need of social reform. This sense of moderation is\nan eaimark of Scandinavia. noted throughout the world.\nAs for private industry, they maintain that government\nownership should be considered only as a last resort after\nprivate initiative fails. It is true the social-democrats\nforesee a gradual transition to socialism, but only by way\nof normal democratic procedures. Even so this advanced\ntype of socialism would be subjected to the traditional\nchecks and balances of a democratic system. This is the\nsort of \u201cdividing line\" the communists won't set their\nfoot across, and social-democrats have been aware of it\nlong before the last war. If it really were so blurred,\nScandinavians certainly would have split the vote between\nsocial-democrats and communists more evenly instead of\ngiving the former such an overwhelming vote of confi\ndence.\nThe social-democrats have waged some of their toughest\nbattles with communists within the labor unions. However\nScandinavian workers are so much more politically con:\nClous and alert than their counterparts in America for\ninstance, that there is no chance whatsoever for a dicta\ntor to impose say a communist minority rule over the main\nbody of a union.\nYes. the socialdemocnts in Scandinavia don't take a\nSeattle 1, Washington\nNorway ls Adopting American Efficiency Methods\nNorwegian interest in American\nefficiency methods received an im\nportant impetus during a 31;. week\nseminar held recently at Golaa Ho\ntel, beautifully situated in the Jot\nunheim mountains in Central Nor\nway.

Tired\nof the resulting tyranny, the\npeople revolted and kicked\nthem out, lock, stock, and cas\nsock.\nAmericans must continue to\nbe alert for abuse of power by\nany group. Government regu\nlatory agencies are provided to\nkeep an eye on many power\nsources with the notable excep\ntion of religion. Any religious\ngroup which asks unusual\nprivileges or favors from the\ngovernment should be under\nimmediate suspicion. Any gov\nernment which seeks to limit,\ndirectly or Indirectly, any of\nour cherished freedoms, must\nfaU under suspicion, although\nit is not necessax-ily justified\nin times of war or emexgency.\nThe final guarantee of liber\nty exists not in any govern\nment or economic system, but\nin the people who make up the\nnation.

The popular argu\nment that a major threat to\nour existence can be countered\nwith programs for better edu\ncation, higher standards of liv\ning and better co-operation in\nworld economic developments\nis not only fallacious, it is a de\nception that can lead rapidly to\ndisaster. If the free peoples of\nthe world do not soon take a\nstand somewhere together\nthey will demonstrably be de\nstroyed separately, by the com\nmunists in \"peaceful conquest.\u201d\n\u201cPeaceful co-existence\u201d is a\nCommunist concept designed\nas an opiate to lull us into a\nfalse sense of security, while\nthey systematically defeat us\nin detail. Dupes in this country\nand others among our allies\nhave set up a clatter against\nthe employment of force dur\ning every Communist aggres\nsion of the last decade. It is\nthey who urge \u201caccommoda\ntion\u201d at every juncture, and\nwho harp on the need for an\n\u201cagonizing re-appraisal\u201d of the\nextent of our international\ncommitments. Extremists in\nthese ranks even urge that we\npitch our nuclear weapons\nshield into the sea. Today\u2019s iso\nlationists, whether they realize\nit or not are actually urging\nappeasement and surrender in\nthe guise of accommodation to\nthe \u201cfacts of life.\u201d If these in\ndividuals were members of a\ncrackpot or lunatic fringe\nmdt a tyranny to exist under\nany name.

Any\nact which saps the vigor of our\npublic school system, as tax\naid to private or secondary\nschools would probably do,\nthreatens our way of life.\nWe can remain a great and\nfree nation by not worrying\ntoo much about emotionally\nloaded labels of any kind, but\nby seeking to, In the words of\nthe Preamble, \"form a more\nperfect union, establish justice,\ninsure domestic tranquility,\nprovide for the common de\nfense, promote the general wel\nfare, and secure the blessing\nof liberty to ourselves and our\nposterity.\u201d\nLester L.

Rice (\"Sword of the Lord )\nAmerica is cursed with a plague of creeping socialism,\notherwise called ' the welfare state. the New Deal, etc.\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt openly set out to \"redis\ntribute the wealth\" as he said. That is, he set out to do by\nlaw what everyone knows is immoral if done by others.\nHE SET OUT TO TAKE AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO\nEARN MONEY A LARGER PROPORTION OF THEIR IN\nCOME AND TO GIVE IT TO PEOPLE WHO DO NOT\nEARN IT. HE SET OUT TO SEE THAT THE MAN WHO\nWORKS HARD DOES NOT HAVE ANY MORE MONEY\nTHAN THE LOAFER. HE SET OUT TO SEE THAT THE\nGOOD CITIZEN DOES NOT PROFIT BY BEING A GOOD\nCITIZEN. HE SET OUT TO VIOLATE THE BIBLE LAW\nOF SOWING AND REAPING. INSTEAD OF HAVING THE\nWEALTH DISTRIBUTED ACCORDING TO WHAT MEN\nEARN, HE SET OUT TO DISTRIBUTE ACCORDING TO\nTHE WAY THE GOVERNMENT WISHES IT TO BE, AND\nTO GAIN VOTES BY THAT METHOD.\nTnat is the heart of the doctrine of Karl Marx, the\nfather of socialism and communism. (The two are the same\nin essence. They hold exactly the same doctrines except\nthat communism seeks to overthrow the government by\nviolence, while socialism seeks to bring about exactly the\nsame state by a slower means.) Karl Marx said, \"FROM\nEACH ACCORDING TO HIS ABILITY: TO EACH ACCORD\n.

After the bill was approved some of the\nindustry's representatives privately expressed surprise that the\nlegislature did not materially increase the tax schedules they\nhad proposed for heavier trucks using Montana highways.\nFinally, we cannot understand the reasoning which led the\n1937 Legislature to give approval to \"reciprocity agreements\nwith certain states which, in so many words boil down to this:\n... If Montana would not tax and license trucks from other\n* -\nstates\u2014other states would not tax Montana trucks\u2014in inter\nstate commerce*. W T hether it be Montana, or the other states\nwith whom reciprocity agreements are in effect, the only bene\nfit derived from such agreements accrues to the trucking oper\nators. Certainly, there is nothing in it for the states who must\nshoulder ever-increasing maintenance costs because of the grow\ning ton mileage of these highway-destroying monsters.\nTherefore, while force of circumstances dictate it is not in\nthe best interests of ourselves as users of the highways to oppose\nthe gas tax initiative, we do suggest that Montana voters raise\nsome pertinent questions about highway financing to their pros\npective legislators between now and General Election Day.\nIt is time the motoring public in Montana began receiving a\nlittle fairer treatment on this matter of highway financing from\nthe state legislature. It is time that the imposition of \"use\",\nfamily trailer, and other nuisance taxes be stopped. It is time\nthe legislature for once did the bidding of the people of the\nstate rather than accepting en toto the tax recommendations of\nlobbyists representing the heavy trucking interests.\n* When traveling on Montana highways note how many out-of-state trucks\ncarry the license plates of one to a dozen other states, but, do not have\na Montana license tag. \"Reciprocity\" with the truck's \"home\" state per\nmits this tax-dodging. Such reciprocity is just another kind of subsidy to\nsubsidy-hating private enterprise.\nTimely Film, \"Government Is Your\nBusiness\", In State Film Library\nThe state department of Public\ninstruction now has in its film li\nbrary, visual education department,\na new' and timely film that may be\nof interest to civic organizations all\nover the state.\nEntitled GOVERNMENT IS YOUR\nBUSINESS the film features the new\nstar Arthur Franz, and according to\nthe description it is \"a forceful, dra\nmatic presentation of a young man\nwho dared everything to show that\ncorrupt government is due more to\nthe weakness of good people than to\nthe strength of evil doers.\"'\nHarry A. Norton, supervisor of the\nvisual education department of the\nstate department of Public Instruc\ntion in calling the attention of the\npublic to the film says, \"it focuses\nattention on the moral responsibility\nof the individual citizen to vote\" and\nshows \"that personal interest is es\nsential for better government.\"\nThose who have previewed the 1\ni film are enthusiastic over the pre\nsentation of the expertly compiled\nmaterial and recommend its use dur\ning the present political campaign\nbefore the November 4th national\nand state elections.\nThe State Film Library has\nceived many commendations for hav\ning stocked the film including praise\nby the Great Falls College of Edu\ncation and the Montana Farmers\nUnion.\nbenefit of others who may have re\nre\nThe film is non-partisan and does\nan excellent job of showing the in\ndividual responsibility of voting.\nTo secure the film write:\nMONTANA STATE FILM LIBRARY\nTHE CAPITOL\nHELENA, MONTANA\nThere is only one print of GOV\nERNMENT IS YOUR BUSINESS in\nthe film library at present, there\nfore, when writing specify the date\nthe film will be' needed, and for the\nOthers Besides Me\nBy GRETCHEN BILLINGS\nOthers besides me are against war;\nothers besides me are sending boys\nto training camps; others besides me\nare asking where are we going? What\nare we accomplishing? Where is it\nto end? Where have we been?\nNow that a political campaign is\nin full swing the questions arise\nlouder and longer.\nOthers like me are heavy hearted\nas we see our man-child strut proud\nly in his \"special\" service uniform.\nOthers like swallow hard at the\ncourage, abandon, and shakey \"Don't\nworry about me, Mom\" when the kids\nsay goodbye. Our kids know no fear\nand when it hits them there is noth\ning we can do for them. They face\nthese things as we would have them\nface everything in ilfe\u2014but must\nwe raise them to face the violent\ndeath of war at 18?\nSo we continue in a political cam\npaign and the men who are destined\nto be our leaders do not discuss our\nboys facing death.\nRepublicans condemn events that\nhave accumulated the number of\nAmerican dead, and the events that\ndecree a grave in a far off land, but\nwhat do they suggest to end it?\nDemocrats glorify the patriotic\npurpose of the number of Ameri\ncan dead and justify the past and\nfuture graves because they died\nfighting on foreign soil and not\nAmerican.\nOther besides me have condemned\nour present state of affairs, many\nnot as forcefully as now, because we\nare in a political campaign, but there\nhave been many others.\nWe, as a nation, have been firmly\nindoctrinated with the conviction that\nwe must fight the Russians, but\nRussian boys are dying.\nWe seem to have been maneuvered\ninto the position where, if we keep\non fighting we are fighting a use\nless war, if we stop we face mortal\nwounds to our national pride.\nI do not consider \"pride\"\ntue. 'My pride has suffered indig\nnities many times in the process of\nbringing forth my sons, raising them\nand providing for them. It could\nsuffer more to save their lives.\nOther besides me are not convinced\nthat the only issues in this campaign\nare the taxes that go for domestic\nno\na vir\nIn the multiple choice political\nquestion, \"Who will be our next Pres\nident\" we will choose between\nwho will quibble about the 15% of\nour national taxes that goes for\nvices to our aged, provide better edu\ncation for our children, and bring\ngreater betterment to the people of\nthe nation. We are not hearing dis\ncussed the 85% that goes into the\nmilitary establishment for destruc\ntion and the death of our sons. It\nwill not be the small per cent that\ngoes for domestic services that will\nruin the country. But discussion of\nthe larger percentage that takes\nearnings in taxes and the cream of\nour posterity is taboo.\nIt is about time we stopped beat\ning our chests in frothy frenzy\ndomestic taxes, over who's candidate\nthe candidate is, and \"who shot the\nbear.\"\nIs it too much to ask that they\nfigure out how they will settle the\nproblem of WAR? If the candidates\nare not capable of finding the\nswev perhaps it should be singled out\nas an issue to be presented directly\nmen\nser\nour\nover\nan\nto the people to be settled. If it is an\nissue too big for a single candidate\nfor the Presidency of the United\nStates lets segregate it from the po\nlitical haraunging and give it to the\nnation.\nOthers besides me would like to\nhave a say in the matter. Others be\nsides me are mothers of the best look\ning sailor in the United States Navy.\nOthers besides me know that what\never their son is called upon to do\nhe will do well and with courage and\nhonor, unto facing death. But others\nbesides me also know that he is there\nnot because of anything he has yet\nhad a chance to decree, but because\nothers as well as me have not spoken\nclearly enough to those in whose\nhands lay the destiny of our youth,\nand the future of the nation.\nWith millions of\nour country's\nyouth and 85%of our national taxes\nbeing spent on war there are many\nothers besides me who have a right\nto ask for some specific\nanswers.\nquests the visual education depart\nment asks that you follow the in\nstructions that accompany the film\nas to date of return.\nFor the Benefit of the \"One Born Every Minute\" . .\nBy A BYSTANDER\nIn the golden days of vaudeville\nno program was complete without a\ntrained seal act. Most of you remem\nber that act. There was usually one\nout-sized seal that put on the major\nperformance on the horns and drums.\nOther smaller sized seals, seals with\nless talent, applauded wildly his ren\ndition on the blaring horn of \"Home\nSweet Home.\" When he finished his\nact he was thrown a piece of more or\nless decayed fish and each member\nof the act got a similar though small\ner reward.\nOf late years, no political campaign\nin Montana is complete without a\nsimilar act by the trained seals. It\nhas become such a regular part of the\nRepublican campaigns that we all\nlook forward to the biennial perform\nance.\nLast Monday noon the act took\nplace again at its usual locale, the\nPlacer Hotel, now owned by Well\nington Rankin and his buddies of\nstored whiskey fame Fred Heineke\nand George Sinton, the big Manhat\ntan rancher.\nMonday afternoon's Helena In\nthe performance. The big seal, as\nusual, was Ed Toomey, Helena law\nyer. On his horn he played from\nstart to finish the old tune about\n\"creeping socialism.\" He presented a\nbill which Lee Metcalf, in 1936, pre\nsented to the Legislature. It was sup\nposed to favor those un-American in\nstitutions, the Farmer's Co-ops. He\nscared the bejabers out of the lit\ntle seals. He told them that if lyee\nMetcalf were elected to Congress\nprivate enterprise would end and\ncreeping socialism, apparently in the\nform of co-ops, would take over.\nHe heralded Wellington D. Ran\nkin, the millionaire rancher, and\nmany times defeated candidate, as\nthe Knight in Shining Armor who\nwould save the country from the\nmenace of creeping socialism. The\nseals applauded more violently than\never.\nThe big seal, Mr. Toomey, had\nlearned his lesson well for he com\npletely forgot to tell the little seals\nthat Wellington D. in his more palmy\ndays, had been active in Socialist\nparty affairs in Montana and a regu\nlar attendant at its meetings in the\nold Galen block just a few doors up\nthe street from the Placer Hotef.\nHis trainer was a good coach, for\nwithout a flap of the tail he plumb\noverlooked telling the little seals that\nRankin had been attorney for the\nSocialist party in Montana for years\nuntil very recent date. The little\nseals were undoubtedly so well train\ned, and have had a part in the act\nso long they would have applauded\neven if the big seal had beat out\nthese facts on the drums.\nWhile the Helena paper didn't\nquote, those of us who have observed\nthe trained seal act over the years,\nknow that the big seal no doubt\nbrought tears to the eyes of the audi\nence and the little seals by playing\nthe tune of the poverty of the Re\npublican party and the need for dig\nging up dough for the poor million\naire Republican candidate for Con\ngress. You may be sure, that under\nthe influence of the\nthe trained seals, check books\nbrought forth and\nmade, that the aging Sir Galahad,\nRankin, could be sent down to Wash\nington to slay the dragon of Social\nism.\nwere\ncontributions\nBut, of course, probably all he\nreally would do would be to tilt\nthe windmill because the Socialism\nthe big seal talked about, exists only\nin the minds of seals and particularly\ntrained ones.\nIt isn t the business of trained\nseals to know that in 1932 there were\nless than 3 million individual busi\nin the United States and that\ntoday there are over 4 million and\nthe business outlook increased from\n51 billion in 1932 to 292 billion in\n1951, trained seals can hardly be\nexpected to understand figures like\nthat and so they go through the tired\nold act with the big seal playing\non the horns and the little seals\nplauding, grinding out the old\nof Creeping Socialism.\nThus in two\nnesses\nap\ntune\nyears time, when\nother decent, liberal candidate ap\npeal s on the scene, the company will\nagain trot out its trained seai\nwith the\nan\nact,\nsame big seal and,\ngo\nthrough the same tired performance\nagain.\nBut those who are old time vaude\nville fans, full om nostalgia for the\npast, will be waiting eagerly for\nthe performance. We want it put\non each year exactly as it was the\nlast and I am confident we will not\nbe disappointed.\nMORE THAN FIVE MILLION\nCREDIT UNION MEMBERS\nWASHINGTON, D. C.\u2014(CNS) \u2014\nMore than 5,100,000 people in the\nUnited States saved and borrowed\nthrough credit unions as of the end\nof 195J, estimates the U. S. Depart\nment of Labor. Their credit unions\nhad assets of more than $1.1 billion,\nof which about $1 billion is in paid\nin share capital. Outstanding loans\nat the end of 1951 totalled nearly\n$750 million, of which 29% was in\nmortgage loans.\nThe credit union insurance com\npany, CUNA Mutual Insurance So\nciety, reported that as of the end\nof last July, it has more than $924\nmillion of insurance in force. Its goal\nis $1 billion by the end of 1952. Only\n43 North American insurance com\npanies have this much protection in\nforce. The society sells insurance to\nboth credit unions and their members.\nStarting with assets of $584, De\ntroit newspapermen built up a cred\nit union in 17 years which now has\nmore than $2 million in assets and\nhas loaned more than $10 million to\nmembers.\n/\nS\nlam* 11 -.\nJt\n:\nn\n/\nI\nM\n'\u25a0\n1/\nor\n\\\nf e\no\nA\n\u2606\nK\n*\n-51\n& &\u00a3\n'-y.-yy\nA\n\u25a0r\nf 1\nr\nV\ni\nM\nm\nAi\nState Senator Hugo\nAronson understands\nthe problems of all.\nyet is unshackled by\nreckless promises.\nHugo Aronson is a\nh business man second,\na Montanan first!\nPol. adv, paid for by Aronson for Governor Club.\nSteve Arnold.

ROBERT DIETZ, Sr.. W. A. BETZ. RAY BROOKS\nJAMES SLAVEN, OS AR FW AN, ROSE STEWART\nC. of C. Would Be Wise To Muzzle\nIts 'Nutty' Speakers\nFor the most flabbergasting spectacle of the week, take\na look at Clem D. Johnson, Virginia businessman and vice\npresident of the U. S. Chamber of Commerce. He\u2019s a prize\nexample of the reasons why that biggest of Big Business or\nganizations would be wise to put muzzles on the men who\nspeak in its name.\nThey seem completely \u201cnutty,\u201d living in a fantastically\nunreal world of their own, wholly out of touch with the hu\nman needs and aspirations of the American people. They say\nthings which shock and anger the people, and then busi\nness wonders why it is not more \u201cpopular.\u201d\nSpeaking before a distinguished audience at the Univer\nsity of Virginia, Johnson said:\nAlternating periods of prosperity and depression \u201care a\nsort of rhythmic pulsation, the one the natural and proper\ncorrective of the other.\n\u201cI don\u2019t share the politicians\u2019 morbid fear of even a\nslight downturn in business,\u201d added the C. of C. official, who\nnever went hungry in good times or bad. \u201cIn my experience,,\ndepressions even at their worst are merely a time when some\npeople are forced to do without things which their parents\nnever had.\u201d\n\u201cBusts,\u201d Johnson declared, are necessary to \u201ccorrect\nthe commodities market and labor market.\u201d In plain words,\nto knock down the prices received by farmers for their pro\nducts, and to make workers willing to accept lower wages\nand longer hours, by creating lines of jobless men at factory\ngates.\nHe also rejoiced at the idea that a good old-fashioned\ndepression would make American people give up their de\nmands for such nonsensical things as higher old-age pen\nsions. A depression would stop \u201cWelfare State Socialism\u201d\nand restore American \u201cfreedom,\u201d he declared.\nFortunately, this Big Business spokesman was answer\ned immediately and before the same audience, by a man with\nquite different views\u2014Bertram M. Gross, executive secre\ntary of President Truman\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers.\n\u201cWe are sickened by the cynicism of the small minority\nwho assert that unemployment is the price we pay for free\ndom,\u201d Gross declared indignantly.\n\u201cWe are sickened by those who assert that depressions\nare inevitable so long as we maintain our capitalistic mode\nof production and distribution.\n\u201cMost of us act on the hypothesis that our future is one\nof unending growth and progress\u2014that the misery of mass\nunemployment can be forever prevented.\u201d\nNow, let\u2019s take a look at Johnson, not as he is, but as\nhe might be if he had just a little sanity and sense. Suppose\nhe had said something like this:\n\u201cThe U. S. C, of C. and business in general wants to do\nall they can to keep farmers prosperous, improve the wages\nand working conditions of workers, provide the highest pos\nsible pensions for the old folks, and make life constantly bet\nter for all the American people. We want to guard against\nthe dangers of excessive \u2018booms,\u2019 but we certainly don\u2019t\nwaAt a \u2018bust\u2019.\u201d\nWouldn\u2019t that make the average citizen a little more\nfriendly to business, and help cut the ground out from under\nCommunists who claim the capitalist system is doomed be\ncause it is the foe of the people?\nBut this C. of C. spokesman and others like him prefer\nto hand ammunition to the Communists by declaring that,\nunder the \u201cAmerican system,\u201d we must again have 15 mil\nlion desperate men and women tramping the streets in hope\nless search of jobs, their dearly-loved families hungry, and\nhundreds of thousands housed in wretched \u201cHoovervilles.\u201d\nHow Stalin and his Kremlin crowd must laugh and rub\nhis hands with glee when they hear of a C. of C. speech like\nJohnson\u2019s! \u201cSee!\u201d the \u201cRed\u201d propagandists say to the\nworld\u2019s peoples, \u201cthat\u2019s just what we have been telling you\nabout American Big Business men!\u201d\nExcise Tax Repeal\nApparently there is no chance of repealing or reducing\nthe wartime excise taxes at the present time. The Senate\nFinance Committee, backed by President Truman, has agreed\nto drop the legislation because of the Korean situation. This\npaper thinks that it was not a necessary decision and that\nthe taxes could have been dropped or slashed without detri\nment to the national interest. There is no particular point\nin arguing that now, however.\nWhy Vote?\nThe head of the American Psychiatric Association has\ngiven us another reason why every eligible jierson should\nvote. In a democracy, he says, anyone who doesn\u2019t vote is\nbound to develop a guilty feeling. And a guilty feeling does\nnot make for mental health. So vote, and maybe you won\u2019t\nneed a psychiatrist.\nBut repeal or drastic cutting of the taxes must again\nbe taken up at the earliest favorable moment. The taxes are\ndiscriminatory and grossly unfair, hitting certain industries always there to meet an emergency. All of us know the\nwhile others/are spared the burden. Right now the taxes are\ntending to keep up and increase the cost of living, already\nshowing an alarming tendency to soar under Korean war\nconditions. They do no good even in the lest of times and\ncould seriously reduce employment and consumption in times\nof slackening business activity.\nLabor In Time Of Crisis\nWe do not have to anticipate an extension of the Korean\nfighting in order to see value in the meeting in Washington\nbetween 22 top labor leaders and Chairman W. Stuart Sym\nington of the National Security Resources Board. We need\nindustrial peace at home if we are to finish our task in Korea\nin the quickest possible time and with the least possible loss,\nof life. We need it because it is part of our national strengths\nwill discourage the potential aggressor.\nTwo world wars have taught government, labor and\nmanagement some methods for keeping the domestic peace,\nin such times of crisis. In each war we have tried to avoid'\ncompulsion, difficult as this has beep when some men have\nbeen drafted for the fighting services while others were left\nsafely in their homes and jobs. The labor leaders who met\nwith Mr. Symington stood firmly for a continuation of this.\npolicy. They asked too, that \u201cany plan for present or future:\nmobilization of American resources provide full and ade\nquate representation for organized labor in the planning^\nand operational divisions of the government agencies invol\nved.\u201d\nIn an emergency so desperate as to involve the national\nexistence the labor spokemen might find these demands in- 1\ncompatible, for in accepting responsibility, as they would\nhave to do, they might have to accept some rigorous conse\nquences of responsibility. That is, they might have to join\nin decisions which would temporarily limit the freedom of^\nlabor. But their instinct is sound. The dignity and freedom\nof the individual are the cause for which we are now fight\ning in Korea and which we hope to maintain, by firm\npeaceful methods, throughout the free world.\nOf course, it is not enough to lay \u2019down the principle..\nLabor, management and government must work patiently J'\ntogether. It is encouraging to know that the labor leaders If\nare forming a 9-man committee for this purpose and that $\nMr, Symington means to consult with management as he\nhas done with labor.\n$\n4\n'Forward, Never Backward\nAn inspiring objective of progress in line with its past\nrecord is set forth by the American Federation of Labor in 1\nits official call for the 69th convention opening Sept. 18 in\nHouston, Texas.\nThe call stresses labor\u2019s unyielding resolution to fight\nfor freedom and liberty on the domestic and international\nfields and sums up AFL determination to press for further\ngains in the following conclusion: hixmu-tww\n\u201cAt this historic convention we will plan to go forward\nnever backward to hold fast to all gains we have made and\nfight for improved conditions of employment and higher\nstandards of living to maintain the freedom guaranteed us\nby the organic law of the land and to refuse to accept legis\nlation which will limit our legal, free trade union activities\nand thus hinder and hamper us in our efforts to lift the stan\ndard of life and living of every American worker to a high\nand still higher level.\u201d\nPrecautions Bring Safety\nAnother demonstration of the fact that mine\u2014and1\nother industrial accidents\u2014can be reduced and prevented\nhas been given, this time by the Miami Copper Co. in its\nmine near Miami, Arizona. The Department of the Interior\u2019s\u2019\nBureau of Mines tells the story, reporting that a 23-year-old\nnon-fatility record in handling and using explosives has been\nachieved by the company by adhering to \u201cbasic principles\u201d\nof safe blasting practice.\nThe bureau says that only a few men handle the ex\nplosives and unauthorized persons are not permitted to touch\nelectrical apparatus. Maintenance patrols detect and correct\nelectrical leaks and faults.\nElectrical blasting has been used exclusively during the\nlast 16 years and 4,000 tons of explosives have been used to\nproduce 60,925,071 tons of ore. In 1949, a Joseph A. Holmes\nSafety Association \u201cCertificate of Honor\u201d was awarded the\nmine.\nMachines Take Jobs of \u2019Men and Mules'\n\u201cMen and mules\u201d are being chased out of the cotton\nfields by giant machines, reports a business writer who\nmade a survey of the \u201cCotton Belt\u201d from coast to coast.\nThe machines are huge mechanical \u201cpickers\u201d and\n\u201cstrippers\u201d which work much faster than human hands, and\ncut the cost of producing cotton by as much as $40 a bale.\nThey are so expensive that small farmers cannot buy them,\nbut they are being used more and more by the big planta\ntion owners, particularly \u201cin the Mississippi delta, the black\nlands of Texas, and in California.\u201d\nThe business writer shows no concern over the fate of\nthe \u201cmen and mules\u201d displaced by these machines, nor about\nthe small farmers who can neither buy the machines nor\ncompete with them.\nYet it seems \u201cplain as the nose on your face\u201d that,\nthough this machanization of cotton-field drudgery could be\na blessing to mankind, it is creating serious problems for the\nSouth and the entire nation.\nTime And Doctors\nWe\u2019ve heard that some doctors now keep small hour\nglasses of sand on their desks, like those used for timing soft\nboiled eggs. The glass is turned over when the patient ar\nrives and when the sand has run through the doctor says:\n\u201cNow that is all the time 1 could give you if we had compul\nsory health insurance or socialized medicine. Just four min\nutes.\u201d\nWhat do they mean? Are there so many people need\ning a doctor\u2019s care and not getting it that a doctor actually\nthinks this would le true if medical treatment should be\nmade available to all who need it? We thought the argument\nagainst a prepaid medical plan (and it\u2019s not Socialism) was\nthat the country didn\u2019t need it.\nMoney Grows\nNot on trees, of course, but if tucked away and put into\nU. S. Savings Bonds. Three dollars grow into four in ten\nyears. If needed before it\u2019s grown, your original money is\nfeeling of, \u201cI just don\u2019t know where it went,\u201d and that a pay\nraise can disappear rapidly\u2014sometimes with nothing much\nto show for it. It should be just as easy to turn the tables\nand save regularly so we could say, \u201cI don\u2019t see where it\ncame from.\u201d Once the habit is formed, it is just as easy.\nAnd lots more fun.\n*. History teaches us beyond question that workers\ncannot have or hold freedom to help themselves in a land\nwhere racial or religious discrimination is allowed to flower\nand flourish. If we, as workers, are to preserve our freedom\nhere in America we must of necessity keep our minds and\nhearts ever alive to this danger. Group hatred breeds hatred\nand smothers the democratic way of life.\u201d\u2014George Meany,\nSecretary-Treasurer, American Federation of Labor.\nTHE POTTERS HERALD, EAST UVERPOQL, OHIO\nB\u2019\nKBCKmF\nkW\nf\u2019\nbut\nOf,\nOR\nWASHINGTON\nE\nby BRADFORD V.

And, inside the family, they admit they have\nmanufactured the \u201csocialism^\u2019 issue deliberately.^ jThe.proof^sjn^^a\np^mphlet^repared byV the Electric Companies Advertising Program\n(ECAP) and Public and You.\u201d qnk\" r-\n(ECAP)'and\u2019labelled\u2018'\u201cThe\nhbefled fhe Public and You. The \u201cyou\u201d there refers\nlto p' amphlet tpll' a saj story. It seems that surveys show over\nwhelming support for the Tennessee Valley Authority, and for extend\ning that idea to other regions like the Missouri and Columbia river\nvalleys. Worse still, for the utilities, is what kind of people think so\nhighly of TVA and extending the program. The survey showed tre\nmendous support by teachers and editors by Republicans by P\u00ae\u00b0P*e\nwho believe in \u201cfree enterprise\u201d. The survey shows 65 percent of the\npeople in the upper income bracket approve of TVA,\nNow, the private utilities want no part of the government public\n?e*power program. When they fought the TVA, they said TVA would\nI ruin them. (They are making more money than ever.) When they\nfought the Rural Electrification program, they cried it would ruin.\nl&ihem.* (They have made more money in the rural areas than ever.)\n^What\u2019s eating them is that the government has been showing up the\n1 '\u201coutrageous rates they have been charging, and where the government\nhps stepped in, the consumers get a break because rates go down.\nSo, since the public generally favors TVA and expansion of the\nidea, the utilities have to attack from another quarter. (The $22,\n000,000,000 utility industry has just hired, at a reported $50,000 a\nyear, a publicity expert to help Purcell L. Smith, who at $65,000 a\nyear is the highest-paid lobbyist in Washington. You help pay their\nsalaries, whether you know it or not.)\nThey\u2019ve looked around, and think they have the answer another\nsurvey, which asked, \u201cWould socialism be a good thing or a bad\nthing for the United States?\u201d To this, 69 percent said \u201cbad\u201d.\nAnd that\u2019s why the utilities are shrieking \u201csocialism.\u201d The pam\nphlet frankly says that \u201cto link our fight to the TVA question would\nrun into a lot oLopposition. But to link our fight to socialism is some\nthing else agsi^JThe people do not want socialism. We\u2019re on favor\nable ground there.\u201d\nWell, you say, let s admit the utilities\u2019 cry of \u201csocialism is a\nphony. But maybe there\u2019s something to this argument against \u201cthe\nwelfare state\u201d being a foreign importation, and not really American.\nSen. Paul H. Douglas, Democrat of Illinois, a former economics\nprofessor who saw action in the Pacific in World War II, took that\none apart July 14, 1950, before the Institute of Public Affairs, Uni\nversity of Virginia, Charlottesville, Va.\nHe traced the idea of the \u201cwelfare state\u201d to the Virginia Declar\nation of Rights, which furnished the framework not only for the De\nclaration of Independence but for the Bill of Rights, adopted 14 years\nlater as the first 10 amendments to the US Constitution.\nThe Virginia declaration was drafted by George Mason. It said\n\u201call men are created equally free and independent and have certain\ninherent natural rights among which are the enjoyment of life\nand liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property and\npursuing and obtaining happiness and safety. Of all the various\nmodes and forms of government that is best which is capable of pro\nducing the greatest degree of happiness and safety.\u201d\nThe Articles of Confederation, Sen. Douglas pointed out, said the\npurpose of the confederation was \u201cfor their common defense, the se\ncurity of their liberties and their mutual and general welfare\u201d.\nThe Constitution of the United States, he pointed out, says it in\nthe preamble that among the five fundamental purposes in forming\nthe \u201cmore perfect union\u2019* was \u201cto promote the general welfare\u201d. The\nfirst paragraph of Section 8, Article 1, of the Constitution itself says\n\u201cThe Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, im\nposts and excises to pay the debts and provide for the common defense\nand general welfare of the United States.\u201d In other words, Congress\nis given specific power to levy taxes in such a way as to provide not\nonly for the \u201ccommon defense\u201d but also the \u201cgeneral welfare\u201d.\nMore, as the debates in the Congress on adoption of the Constitu\ntion showed, the intent of the language finally adopted was to give\nCongress the power to spend for the general welfare.\n\u201cThe welfare concept\u201d, declared Douglas, \u201cis in the forefront as\nan equal partner of justice, domestic tranquillity, defense and liberty.\nAnd in the first clause of Article 1, Section 8, there is provided an\neffective way of promoting this general welfare, namely, to spend\nfor it.\u201d\nDouglas pointed out the doctrine was stated by Mason, Jefferson\nand Madison, and restated by Lincoln when he said government was\nnot only \u201cof\u201d and \u201cby\u201d the people but also \u201cfor\u201d the people affirmed\nlater by Justices Hughes, Brandeis, Cardozo, and Stone. Douglas\nadded:\n\u201cBehind and beneath them, it has sprung from the well-springs\nof the American people themselves For with all their proper em\nphasis upon individualism and self-reliance, the American people have\nalways known that there are some burdens too heavy to be borne alone\nand some evils which can only he removed by collective action. To\nhelp bear these burdens and to help remove these evils, it is proper for\nthe government, as one of the agencies for collective betterment,\nto act.\n\u201cBecause the state has concerned itself with the troubles and dif\nficulties of average people who have little property and low incomes,\nit has helpi'd to win and retain their loyalty anti devotion to the demo\ncratic principles, which, though under attack in most of the world,\nstand firm in America. They stand firm here because they are rooted\niu the hearts of the people who see in government, not an instrument\nof oppression, or an icy institution indifferent to their needs, but an\nagency which is carrying into effect at least some of the principles\nof human brotherhood.\u201d\n\u2014In Chicago, even members of the sign painters and bill posters\nunion chortled happily when the Justice Department charged the Gen\neral Outdoor Advertising Co. with monopolizing outdoor advertising\nin 1500 cities east of the Rocky Mountains. Most of the anti-labor\npolitical advertising that the two unions had to put up was carried\nby the General Outdoor Advertising outfit.\n\u2014in Washington, the NLRB slapped down a Puerto Rican com\npany that tried to break a strike by holding oUt of employes\u2019 wage\nchecks the entire balance of loans made by the company to individual\nworkers before they voted to strike.\n\u2014In Honolulu, striking bakers obligingly provided housewives\nnot only with breadmaking recipes but also with samples of a ready\nmix dough which they got from an American milling firm by the\nsimple expendient of having their wives write over and over again\nfor the samples. The bakers quickly won their strike when the out\nraged president of one of the strikebound firms discovered that he\nwag eating biscuits his wife had made from the strikers* recipes.\n\u2019WW\u2019\nBEHIND THE HEADLINES\u2014\nThursday, July 27, 1950\nivik-acV\u2018\nby LES FINNEGAN r\u2019\n\u2014In Annapolis, Md., the country\u2019s newest type of strike stopped\nconstruction on a new $43,000,000 Chesapeake Bay bridge, Five divers\nwalked off the job when the contractor refused to grant extra pay for\n\u201ctank time\u201d, which is the half-hour or more divers must spend in a\ndecompression chamber to avoid getting the \u201cbends.\u201d Carpenters,\npiledrivers and dockbuilders walked out in sympathy after the con\ntractor advanced the strange argument that if the divers came up\nfrom the bottom more slowly they wouldn\u2019t have to spend so much\ntime in the tank.\n\u2014In Pittsburgh, one of the several hundred milk drivers who re\nturned to work after winning a 21-day strike reported back to his of\nfice that every family but one on his route had cancelled its milk order.\nThe one customer who didn\u2019t was President Harry A. Tevis of the\nstriking ipnon.\n\u2014In New York City, Arthur Brown was hired as a porter by the\nCushman Bakery Co. and assigned to one of the company\u2019s stores at\nFar Rockaway. Brown walked into the shop and told the clerk \u201cI\u2019m\nhere to slick up the place.\u201d Clerk and customers all thought they had\nheard Brown say \u201cstick up.\u201d Within five minutes three radio cars full\nof cops and with sirens screaming raced up to the bakery. And within\n15 minutes Brown was in a precinct station where he was grilled for a\nhalf-hour before they finally believed his story,\n\u2014In Melbourne, Australia, Immigration Minister Harold Holt\nannounced that if Harry Bridges, a native Australian, is deported\nfrom the US Australia will not accept him. The decision inspired one\nAussie union leader to recommend that Bridges be sent to Bolivia or\nAfghanistan, neither of which have any coastline or longshoremen.\n\u2014In Paris, France a labor relations court took up the unpreced\nented problem of whether an employe has a right to tattoo a picture\nof his boss on the place where he sits down. A worker in a wholesale\ndrygoods firm complained to the labor court that he was fired when\nhis boss discovered where his likeness was tattooed.\n\u2014In Chicago, Louis Matey, an employee of Sears Roebuck, spent\nfive hours trapped in a grease chute and was rescued when it was dis\ncovered that his release could \u2019be effected only by left-handed men be\ncause of the chute\u2019s awkward location. After a dozen left-handed fireT\nmen got him out, Matey said he was quitting because \u201cI don\u2019t lik\nthis forced overtime.\u201d W\n\u2014In Washington, D. C., the International Association of Mach\ninists, largest unaffiliated union in the US, took inventory and was\namazed to discover the things its members produced in addition to\nsuch items as machinery, locomotives, and bridges. Today\u2019s machinist\ncan also be found making ice, spaghetti, chewing gum, whisky, ladies\ndresses, salt, caskets, pencils, smoking pipes, dog food, and snuff.\n\u2014In Birmingham, England, Communist members of a steel work\ners\u2019 local began soliciting members\u2019 signatures to a huge petition\npublished as part of the phony Moscow-inspired \u201cpeace drive.\u201d The\npetition was left overnight in the union hall because the Comrades had\nhopes that the union\u2019s meeting the next night might support the\n\u201cdrive.\u201d Before the meeting began the petition was again circulated\nand 150 new signatures were collected. Feeling very much embolden\ned one of the chief Communists got on the floor and proposed, since\n150 members had signed the petition, that the local union officially\nendorse it. To the utter amazement of the comrades it was passed\noverwhelmingly and without a word of debate. Only then did they\ndiscover that overnight someone had substituted for the peace peti\ntion a resolution supporting the United Nations action on Korea. The\nchange hadn\u2019t been noticed because the Communists had rolled up their\nlong petition like a scroll!\n\u2014In Pittsburgh, the most optimistic group of unionists in the\ncountry was revealed when the United Paperworkers asked the head\nof the US Gypsum Co. to help end their strike at the company\u2019s Oak\nmont plant. The man they appealed to is Sewell Avery, also head of\nMontgomery Ward, the man who broke the back of another local and\nhad to be carried out of his building by US troops during wartime.\nReuther 100-Year Plan A Fresh Breeze\nIn Washington Murk\nBy ALVAINE HAMILTON & CUSHMAN REYNOLDS\nWalter Reuther\u2019s 100-year peace plan came like a fresh breeze in\na week when world news was bad. GI\u2019s were steadily giving ground\nin Korea (although American planes may have been redressing par \u2014.\nof the balance behind the Communist lines). At home people waiteu^L\nfor word from the President. How much would he ask for the Korean\nfight and other fights that might be around-the corner? Would he\nask for rationing and price controls? Americans were determined but\napprehensive. There seemed to be no goal despite the activity. \u201cAfter\nKorea, what?\u201d some were asking. Then Reuther spoke out.\nOf course, Reuther\u2019s plan, announced jointly in Detroit and Wash\nington July 18, is not a cure-all. It poses more questions than it\nanswers. But its terms and magnitude offer Americans of all political\nand economic stripes a basis for thinking about the world and the\nfuture. Thirteen billion dollars a year for world development for 100\nyears staggers the imagination. The Marshall Plan is dwarfed. The\npaltry millions Senators have been haggling about for Point Four\nbecome a drop in the bucket. Reuther has carried Marshall Plan and\nPoint Four thinking to a logical conclusion. His plan, simple in out\nline, would be Democracy\u2019s boldest offensive against Communism.\nThe president of the Auto Workers proposes that for the next\ncentury the American people, working through the United Nations,\npledge $13 billion a year for the world\u2019s social and economic recon\nstruction. The 100-year money total would about equal world\u2019s social\nand economic reconstruction. The 100-year money total would about\nequal the cost of World War II. Other nations could pledge funds as\nthey wished.\nFirst Congress would have to adopt the plan. Then the President\nwould submit it to other nations. When a majority of UN members\naccept, a conference would be called to achieve disarmament, establish\nan inspection system, and set up a police force. A military defense\nplan would be necessary in case a substantial section of the world re\nfused to participate. The Soviet Union and its satellites could come in\nor stay out as they wished. A second conference, the Peoples\u2019 World\nAssembly for Peace, would then work out the details which would\nbe put into effect through the United Nations aAd the participating\ngovernments. Present American military plans would be unaffected.\nReuther himself is guilty of understatement when he says: \u201cWe can\nseize the initiative for peace by putting into effect a greatly expanded\naid program geared to the economic and social needs of people through\nthe world while promoting a practical program of economic and social\njustice at home.\u2019*\nWhether the American Congress will accept such a plan is, for the\nmoment, beside the point. As a matter of cold fact, little can be ex\npected of Congress along this line. While Reuther was drafting hi\n100-year program, Senators were trying to slash the Marshall PlaW\n\u201cbecause of the world situation,\u201d a contradiction that defies expla\nnation. The Senate Appropriations committee, under prodding from\nthe White House, was voting to restore the cut it had made in Point\nFour funds* but the Point Four timidly engineered by Congress was a\nfar cry from what men of vision had hoped it might be. Perhaps\nReuther would at least succeed in injecting a little vision into Con\ngressional thinking by stirring up controversy. The anticipated re\nactions of the Tafts and Byrds might actually make others mad enough\nto ponder Reuther\u2019s proposal.\nWhile Reuther was speaking out, Sen, Taft was writing condes\ncendingly about \u201cwar with a few Korean Communists.\u201d Nevertheless,\nTaft seized the opportunity to say that the expense of Korea wotrid\nmake it necessary to cut domestic government expenditures, \u201cparticu\nlarly those which require the purchase of materials and the use of\nlabor.\u201d Taft anticipates a steel shortage and he may be right. Reu\nther, in announcing his 100-year plan, specifically charges that \u201cthe\nowners of the steel industry\u201d are \u201cwedded to a program of planned\neconomic scarcity with low volume and high prices.\u201d He calls for ex\npanded steelmaking capacity. He also says that if \u201cidle, government\nbuilt war plants\u201d were put into operation we could produce civilian\nmilitary goods in any amount required. Taft undoubtedly would ob\nject. \u2019\u201cSocialism,\u201d he\u2019d cry.\nBut Taft would be wise to heed Reuther before he cries too loud\nly. Many liberal economists are of the opinion that how we distri\nbute the production of military and civilian goods in our total national\nproductive plant may in the end be more important than manpower\nor wage controls. In an economy operating virtually at full blast, as\nours is these days, the problem is less one pf putting people to work\n\u2022than to determining what they can produce.\nFull blast or not, however, Reuther points out that 3% million\nAmericans are unemployed an dthat another 2 million are working\npart-time but are available for full-time jobs. The UAW president says\nthat 3 million more jobs, in the idle war-built plants, presumably,\nwould produce the $13 billion a year his plan would require. If the\nworld crisis worsens, we may create those extra jobs\u2014later on. We\ncould do it now with a clear objective in view. But that\u2019s an imagina\ntive approach that might s+r'a --------------~J 9\nmajority."}, {"title": "catholic times.", "city": ["Columbus"], "date": "19520201", "raw_text": "THE\nCATHOLIC TIMES\nPublished Every Week by\nThe Catholic Times, Inc.\nColumbus, Ohio\nNOTICE: Send All Changes of Address to\nP. 0.

Fink\nPresident, Catholic Press Association\nThe Catholic Press Association of the United\nStates has adopted as its slogan for Catholic Press\nMonth of 1952: Read Your Catholic Press\u2014Millions\nWish They Could!\nThe slogan\u2014like all good slogans\u2014stands alone.\nIt needs no interpretation or embellishment. But it\ndoes prompt a few thoughts.\nRead Your Catholic Press\u2014Millions Wish They\nCould!\nWho are those millions? They are victims of\ncommunist persecution. They live in Russia and a\ndozen satellite nations which have been taken over\nby the Reds within the past few\u2019 years These nations\neven more than \"Holy Russia\u201d before 1918, were\nChristian (Catholic) nations. They are still Catholic\nat heart. Their freedom to worship\u2014and even to\nbelieve in God\u2014has been taken from them for the\ntime being, but Christ will conquer and His people\nwill return to Him and His Church.\nBut how was the freedom of the people of the\nsatellite nations taken from them\u2019\u2019 Not through\nforce alone. The truth was first suppressed. Then\ndeceptive propaganda was made to serve the cause\nof anti-Christ.\nIn every nation now under Communist domina\ntion the first victim of Red oppression was the re\nligious press. With it silenced, and an anti-religious\npress cleverly edited and widely circulated among\nthe people to supplant it, the way was prepared for\nalmost complete suppression of the Church, and of\nthe inalienable rights of the people.\nIt could happen here. The ultimate aim of com\nmunism is to gain total control of the world, through\nforce if necessary, but by more subtle means if pos\nBible.\nIn our country communism is now in popular\ndisfavor But it still has thousands of agents who in\nveiled treason are endeavoring to undermine our\nChristian form of government They use the per\nverted press to its fullest value to destroy faith and\nmorals. If they have their way, the time will come\nwhen Catholics in the United States will wish they\ncould read a Catholic Press.\nThe Catholic Press is our nation\u2019s best informed\nand most consistent antagonist of communism How\never, it is the constructive teaching of the princi\nples of Christianity and Christian government that\nit best serves its readers. An informed people will\nnot be deceived. A people whose patriotism is\ngrounded in religion will not be conquered.\nPope Pius XII has said \u201cAnything which you will\ndo for the good press, 1 will consider as having been\ndone for me personally The Catholic Press is very\nclose to my heart.\u201d His Holiness bestows the Apos\ntolic Blessing on all who help the Catholic Press.\nAnd if the Catholic Press is helped in these days\nthe persons whom it serves the Church and the\nnation\u2014are the real benefactors.\n......... -o\nStudents Io the Right\nA student movement to the right seems to he\ngrowing in the colleges of the nation Started last\nSeptember in California it now has 24 chapters in\ncolleges and universities from the west coast to\nthe east, including Kenyon College in Ohio The\nmovement aims to fight communism and socialism\nand promote the principles of the American Re\npublic.\nAlthough the new student organization hears\nthe title, \"National Collegiate MacArthur Clubs.\u201d\nit is expected to change to a new name this sum\nmer It professes not to be a political group and\nmembership does not necessarily mean endorse\nment of General MacArthur The platform calls\nfor opposition to immorality in government, social\nist expansion, appeasement, and waste in govern\nment.\nOne of the spokesmen for the movement said the\nother day that. \u201cCommunists and socialists, along\nwith the giobaloney crowd, took over virtually every\nstudent organization, and exerted tremendous in\nfluence on collegiate thinking, with a core of a\nvery few devoted followers on each campus. We\nbelieve we can do the same thing, with the same\nmethods, especially since we have the right and\nthe cause of \u201cAmerica, on our side.\u201d\nThese right wing students have heen selected\ndeliberate!.' The hope is to build a group of tn\ntelligent leaders, not a mass political movement.\nThere has been no aid from political or business\nsources. Already the movement has snatched stu\ndent government from leftwingers on one college\ncampus.\nIt can only be hoped that this movement will\navoid political traps, be courageous against left\nwing opposition and smears, so that one day the\ntrend will be to the right among students and pro\nfessors who have learned the other way. It is\nsaid that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has\na ir-t of more than 5,000 professors who have heen\naffiliated with communist fronts The harm they\nhave done can only be estimated It is good to see\ngood patriotic young people moving to get out from\nunder the bad reputation their loud mouthed left\nuing professors and fellow students have given\nthem As is always the case, it only takes a few\nto spoil things for mans The great majority of\nAmerican youth are good and patriotic. They have\nbeen very patient and long suffering It is ardent'v\nhoped that they will he as prudent and persever\ning as their liberal brothers have been cunning and\nzealoua.\nA Retraction Is In Order\nPity is the one emotion that -cerns to rise fore\nmost in the hearts of atholies when they read of\nthe activities of Paul Bianshard. Not pity for them\nselves but rather pity for this seemingly gifted man\nspending all his time and energy in such a strenu\nous program of hate and bigotry.\nThe schedule of lectures and radio broadcasts\nof Blanshard is a formidable one It must be tiring\nin the extreme to keep such a schedule and sustain\nthe suicidal emotion of hate for so long.\nBlanshard has been carrying on his program\nwithout much help, naturally, from the opposition\nif you can apply that term to the Church In reality\nthe Church does not so much actively oppose him\nas passively ignore him. It is opposition in the sense\nthat Gibraltar opposes the lapping of the sea around\nthe base of that Impregnable fortress.\nSomething that will arouse a different emotion,\nthough, in Catholics is that article of Thomas Sugrue\nwhich was quoted last week in Time magazine.\nHere is a man who purports to be a Catholic and yet\nis coming very close to playing the same game as\nBlanshard. In fatet, he is making himself a fitting\nhelpmate in the cause of bigotry by writings that\ncould easily be mistaken for Blanshard\u2019s.\nMr. Sugrue\u2019s biographical data in \u201cWho\u2019s Who\u201d\ndoes not carry any indication that he is a Catholic\nalthough he saw fit to list a great number of other\norganizations of which he is a member. This may be\nan indication of how important he holds his Catholic\nism.\nThe particular harm that will come from the\nrantings of the two men will be in direct proportion\nto the seriousness with which they are taken by\nthose outside the Church.\nThere are great numbers of non-Catholics who\nsee Blanshard for what he is and who rightfully re\npudiate him. They know that he is not speaking for\nthem and certainly not for Catholicism.\nThe case is entirely different, though, with Su\ngrue. Here is a man saying practically the same\nthings about the Church\u2014and he says that he is a\nCatholic. His potential for harm is one hundred\ntimes that of all the Blanshards.\nWe are not saying that everything that Sugrue\nsays is wrong, or that all of his blows miss the mark.\nThey all do not. It is the fact that the readers of\nthe Christian Herald, the Protestant paper in which\nSugrue\u2019s article first appeared, will not be able to\nsift the valid points he makes from the veiled half\ntruths\u2014things that are always more dangerous than\na direct lie.\nSugrue is by profession a writer. He should be\nable to say precisely what he means. If he did not\nmean exactly what he wrote, a retraction is defin\nitely in order.\nJust Among Ourselves\nPassing Comment Considered or Inconsiderate\nAfter a pause,\u2014which we hope has been re\nfreshing for readers of the Catholic Times,\u2014this\ncolumn of chit-chat reappears. It is a little late\nfor New Year\u2019s greetings, for the year is no longer\nnew. But this is our first appearance in 1952\nsalutations of a sort are in order, and resolutions\ntoo. Hail then the readers who have wondered,\nnot hopefully, where the little column went. And\nstrong resolves to be as little boring as may be in\nthe coming eleven months.\nOver in France, the educators and the literary\nfolk are celebrating the 200th anniversary of the\nediting of their famous Encyclopedic. This work,\nsays a current review, is regarded by many French\nmen as \u201cthe Voice of Reason,\u201d \u201ca bright ornament\nof the Enlightenment,\u201d \u201ca major intellectual wea\npon of the Revolution,\u201d and \u201cthe foundation stone\nof the new secularism.\u201d It seems a little odd, in\nview of what this voice, ornament, weapon, and\nfoundation stone have accomplished in two cen\nturies, that there should be rejoicing and cele\nbration. But, in Mr. Dooley\u2019s phrase, \u201cThe Frinch\nare a tumulchuse people.\u201d And, to adapt Bill Nye\u2019s\nremark about another nation, \u201cThe French do\nthings differently.\u201d\nFacing such a world as that of 1952, it ought to\nbe evident that the Voice of Reason has not uni\nformly prevailed, in France or elsewhere, these\npast 200 years. Some tricky ventriloquists have been\nat work. Not the least of these were the editors\nand writers of the Encyclopedic, notably their chief,\nDenis Diderot, a man in whom the Voice exclaim\ned, \u201cWe must put theology to the sword.\u201d\nIt should be manifest that through two cen\nturies the Enlightenment has turned to an Egyp\ntian fog in which each man\u2019s hand is raised against\nhis brother, no one knowing where he strikes in\nthe darkness. Nor has the great Revolution pro\nvided the golden fruits of liberty, equality, and\nbrotherhood, for the garnering of which it was\nlaunched. And the new secularism, which is now\nthe old and world-wide secularism, has wrought\nceaselessly for destruction it has killed ideals,\npeace, hope, and decent morals. There is little\nindeed of the Voice of Reason in all this. Rather,\nand unmistakably, there is here only the Voice\nof Unreason.\nYet this is the occasion for reverent commem\noration among the French of 1952. The Sorbonne\nhas directed the preparation of six monographs on\nthe Encyclopedic, and the Ministry of Education\nhas ordered teachers to lay special stress on the\nstudy of the work. One of the members of that\nMinistry declares that the Encyclopedic \u201cby the\nspirit in which it was undertaken marks the\nturning point in ideas which ushered in our mod\nern times.\u201d\nWell, we are not too happy in our modern times.\nThe ideas which burgeoned at \"the turning point\u201d\nhave proved to be largely mistaken ideas. Diderot\nand his companions of the Encyclopedic hoped\nthat their work would not be done in vain nor was\nit. Rut it was certainly not done to the lasting\nbenefit of their nation or of mankind.\nThe Encyclopedic was meant to open the world\nof all knowledge to the people. It gave much\nknowledge to be sure, but it gave much that is\nnot knowledge, and it \u201cslanted\u201d many of its in\nformative articles in such wise as to make them\npolitical, sociological, or irreligious harangues.\nMost leaders of thought and action in Europe\nand America are full of talk these days about\n\"Spiritual values\u201d and the need of a return to re\nligious allegiance. Faced by the wild destructive\nness of Asiatic barbarism, which is professedly\natheistic, the civilization once called Christian is\naware of the inadequacy of secularism, enlighten\nment that fails to enlighten, and the Voice of\nReason which is shown by experience to be a phony.\nYet these leaders, with all their chatter of spiritual\nvalues, are \u201cmoving about in worlds not realized.\u201d\nThey become articulate in the favored reviews as\napproving the current celebration in France, and\nspeaking of Diderot and the other encyclopedists\nas men who have served their follows well,\u2014lib\nerators of thought, enlightened teachers, pioneers\nin the ways of freedom and democracy.\nThe plain fact is that modern men are talking\na language they do not understand when they speak\nof things spiritual and supernatural. The new\nsecularism has done its work very thoroughly. And\nwhile it is currently the fashion to bow distantly\nto God and to mutter words about spiritual values,\nthere is nothing of understanding or deep con\nviction in these things. There is at best only a\ngroping after something sensed as requisite, yet\nill-defined, vague, intangible. The Voice of Reason\nis still but a misleading echo among the rocks of\nreality.\nWe who hear the voice of that Church to which\nGod\u2019s own authority is given are privileged above\nall estimation We hear the Voice of Reason sound\ning in completes! harmony with the infallible Voice\nof Revelation. It is, however, not alone our priv\nilege, but our sternest duty, to awaken other ears\nto the understanding of that Voice. By prayer, by\ndevout life, by stifling in ourselves the arid spirit\nof secularism, we shall clarify our own hearing\nand win our fellowmen and brothers to the under\nstanding of Him to Whom it was said of old, \u201cThou\nhast the words of eternal life.\u201d\nM1\niVk.\n-St\nTHE CATHOLIC TIMES, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY, 1, 1852\nWASHINGTON LETTER\nWASHINGTON Universal\nMilitary Training is still con\ntrary to the American tradition.\nAnd it is still a very debatable\nissue, and ought to be debated\nwell.\nThis reminder would seem to\nbe necessary, in view of some\nremarks made by Senator Rich\nard B. Russell of Georgia, chair\nman of the Senate Armed Ser\nvices Committee, in introducing a\nUMT bill in the Senate. He said\nwe are \u201cat a crossroads in his\ntory where the desirability of\nuniversal Military Training is no\nlonger a debatable matter.\u201d\nProponents of UMT may be\nexpected to utilize every argu\nment, oratorical and otherwise,\nthat they can possibly command.\nAt the same time, it is to be\nhoped that they will not attempt\nto blind the American public to\nthe fact that this is a serious\nStep\u2014and that to take it repre\nsents a break with what we have\nstood for up till now. It is es\npecially to be hoped that no\none will attempt to create the\nimpression that it is unpatriotic\nto debate this proposal.\nUMT, it should be understood,\nis not the same as Selective Ser\nvice, or the draft. Selective Ser\nvice recognizes the existence of\na critical emergency and calls\nup men between certain ages\nfor active military service. How\never, it is not intended that this\ncompulsory service be demanded\nafter the emergency has passed.\nOn the other hand, UMT is not\nFATHER HIGGINS\ned reading for every American\nhaving anything to do with the\nEuropean labor movement eith\ner as reporter, economist, gov\nernment official, or labor rep\nresentative.\nThe book is entitled \"Juda\nism and Modern Man\u201d (Farrar,\nStraus and Young, New York,\n$4.00). The five chapters com\nprising section three show a\ngreater insight into the problem\nof \u201cReligion and Society\u201d and\na more profound awareness of\nthe dangers of secularism in\neconomic, social and political\nlife than any other non-Catho\nlic publication we have read in\na long, long time.\nProfound Understanding\nIf Herberg were a Catholic,\nhe would probably be written\noff by Paul Blanshard and other\npesudo-liberal publicists as a be\nnighted medievalist or would-be\nfascist. But Herberg is a Jew\nand a very devout one at that.\nHe is also a well known progres\nsive, having served for many\nyears as director of research and\neducation for the ILGWU. There\nare few \"intellectuals\u201d who have\nserved the American labor\nmovement so faithfully and so\nwell, fewer still who can write\nabout it so intelligently. His\nfrequent articles in Commentary\nand other religious periodicals\non the ethical aspects of cur\nrent trade union developments\nare in a class by themselves\nand deserve the widest possible\ncirculation. It is to be hoped\nthat they will eventually be\npublished in book form.\nFading Away\nogg\nUMT Violates U.S. Tradition\n-.V\nexpected to end with the emer\ngency but to continue on. Brief\nly, it would make youths liable\nfor six months of active military\ntraining upon reaching the age\nof 18. After that, they would\nserve seven and a half years in\nthe reserve. Judging from the\ntenor of speeches being made by\nproponents of the bill, there is\nno doubt in their minds that it\nwould be the law of the land\nfrom here on in.\nSenator Russell challenged\nthe arguments that UMT might\n\u201cmilitarize the country,\u201d corrupt\nthe morals of young trainees and\ndisrupt educational programs\nthroughout the country. He also\nsaid: \u201cSome men of the cloth\nhave been deceived into making\nfantastic arguments against it.\u201d\nIt is not known what \u201cfantastic\narguments\u201d Senator Russell has\nheard, but for the most part\narguments put forward by \u201cmen\nof the cloth\u201d have seemed pretty\nsensible.\n\u201cMen of the cloth\u201d have point\ned out that UMT establishes a\npermanent policy of compulsory\nmilitary training and that this\nis contrary to the American tra\ndition\u2014and it is. Many people,\nnot necessarily \u201cm e n of the\ncloth,\u201d have said that- UMT\nmight militarize the country.\nAnd it might. Certainly compul\nsory military service, as a na\ntional policy, has tended to mil\nitarize some other countries.\n\u201cMen of the cloth\u201d have been\namong those who have question\u00ad\nThe True Nature Of\nWill Her\nta e former\nstaff member\nof the Interna\ntional Ladies\u2019\nGarment\nWorkers\u2019 un\nion, has just\npubl i s e a\nvery important\nbook. Parts of\nit ought to be\nmade requir\u00ad\nTo the best of our knowledge,\nHerberg has a more profound\nunderstanding of European so\ncialism than any other non\nCatholic American who has writ\nten on the subject. That is why\nwe think it is important that\nhis recent book be studied very\ncarefully by those of his fellow\nAmericans (their name is legion\nat the present time) who have\nbeen assigned, in one capacity\nor another, to the field of in\nternational labor. Failure on\ntheir part to understand the his\ntory and the philosophy of\nEuropean socialism and fail\nure to appreciate the differences\nbetween the European and Am\nerican labor movements can\nprove fatal to the success of\ntheir mission.\nDominant Motif\nPaul Blanshard says that\nEuropean socialism, historical\nly, \u201cwas not anti-religious in the\nlarger meaning of that term\n...\u201d It was merely \u201canti\nclerical.\u201d Herberg, on the con\ntrary, says that \"the socialist\nmovement, outside of Britain,\narose in modern times as an\nanti-religious movement.\u201d It\nwas worse than anti-clerical.\n\u201cOn the spiritual level.\u201d Her\nberg continues, \u201cit proclaimed\na militant, atheistic material\nism and thus came forward as\nthe protagonist of a rival total\nphilosophy claiming the alleg\niance of Western man Mili\ntant secularism very early be\ncame the dominant motif in\nmodern socialism This doc\ntrinaire secularism not only rob\nbed socialism of its legitimate\nsource of moral power it not\nonly confused its insight and\nits understanding of the reali\nties of human life most fate\nful of all, it converted social\nism into an idolatrous pseudo\nreligion and thus drove it into\nsuicidal opposition to its own\ntrue source of being.\u201d\nThis is substantially the same\nthing that Popes Leo XIII and\nPius XI said about socialism in\nWil\nI\nA\nI\nrf. 1\ned the wisdom of acting upon\nanything as serious and as per\nmanent as UMT as though it\nwere emergency legislation. In\nthis, they would seem to be\nright.\nAnd there seems little doubt\nthat UMT would cause serious\ndislocations in educational pro\ngrams. Many small colleges, not\nhaving state support, are having\na very hard time of it right now\nbecause of Selective Service,\nwhich is only temporary.\nEvery debate in Congress has\nbrought up the question of\nwhether we ought to have Selec\ntive Service and UMT at the\nsame time. That leads some peo\nple to ask why do we have to\nhave UMT when we already\nhave Selective Service? Propon\nents of UMT say it offers a bet\nter plan for preparedness than\ndoes Selective Service. But some\nobservers point out that UMT\nwould have little chance of en\nactment unless it were brought\nup during an emergency, and\nto meet the present emergency\nwe already have Selective Ser\nvice. UMT is not an emergency\nprogram, but it can only be put\nthrough while an emergency ex\nists.\nIn any event, Americans have\nthe right to debate UMT, and it\nought to be debated. If adopted\nit means a definite break with\nour past traditions. It is a step\nabout which we ought to have\nall possible knowledge before\nwe take it.\nSocialism\ntheir great encyclicals\u2014only to\nbe misunderstood by many\nAmericans and ridiculed by\nothers as a couple of hopeless\nreactionaries. Be that as it may,\nAmericans who are working in\nthe field of international labor,\nin whatever capacity, ought to\nlearn as much as possible about\nthis historical \u201cschism between\nsocialism and religion\u201d on the\nContinent of Europe.\nInnocent* Abroad\nUnless they know something\nabout the history of this unfor\ntunate cleavage and understand\nthe principles involved, they are\nbound to make a lot of serious\nmistakes. They will be, literally,\n\u201cinnocents abroad,\u201d trying to in\nterpret European labor develop\nments solely in the light of\nAmerican experience. They will\nunderestimate the importance\nof the so-called Christian unions\nand will postpone, rather than\nhasten, the development of co\noperation between socialist and\nChristian unions by favoring the\nformer and neglecting, if not\nopenly offending, the latter. This\nis precisely what many of them\nhave already done\u2014for want of\nan adequate understanding of\nthe European situation\u2014only to\nconfess later that they had made\na mistake and lessened the ef\nfectiveness of their work. New\ncomers to the field of interna\ntional labor can avoid these mis\ntakes by making a careful study\no\u2019 Herberg\u2019s analysis of social\nism before they leave for the\nContinent.\nIt should be added that Her\nberg is optimistic about the\nfuture. European socialism, he\nsays, \"is no longer a rival re\nligion it has been reduced to\nthe rather more modest pro\nportions of a program of social\nand economic reconstruction.\u201d\nVirtually all European socialists,\nhe says, \u201cagree that the tradi\ntional anti-religious bias of mod\nern socialism has proved a dis\naster and must be eradicated\nif socialism is to have any fu\nture.\u201d\nRICHARD PATTEE\nGRETTA PALMER\nIt is an old\ncliche of the\nschools that\nyou never\nknow a thing\nwell until you\nknow how to\nteach it to\nsomeone else\nand to a\nsomeone pre\nferably young\ner and duller\nthan you.\nInitiative Needed\nTo Combat Reds\nLast week I\nexamin e\nbriefly the\nproblem of\nUnited States\npropag a n a\nabroad and\no i n ted out\nthat one of\nthe major\nweaknesses\nof our propa\nganda effort is\nthe fact that\nwe refuse\neven to recog\u00ad\nnize that we are indulging in\npropaganda. It would'Seem in\nordinately difficult to do an ef\nfective job when one is so coy\nas to refrain from admitting\nthat the job at hand is even\nlegitimate. The first hurdle to\nget over is frank recognition\nthat we are doing propaganda,\nthat we intend to continue it,\nand that it is a necessary means\nfor carrying on relations in this\nabsurd world in which we live.\nSince we are engaging in pro\npaganda in spite of ourselves\nand might as well confess it,\nthen what seems to be wrong\nwith the things we are actually\ndoing?\nTotally Passive\nI would say that the first de\nfect, and a major one, is that\nwe are going at it in a totally\npassive way. The Soviet Union\nunbound by any scruples\u2014\ncarries on a propaganda that is\nat once aggressive, vital and af\nfirmative. Of this there can oe\nno serious doubt. Our policy\nwould seem to be one of pure\ndefense, of a sort of querulous\nrepartee to what the USSR has\nto offer. We wait patiently for\nthe adversary to choose his\npoint, plot his approach, select\nthe most vulnerable opening and\nstrike.\nOnce the blow has been struck,\nwe mount a kind of defense to\nfend it off. If the Soviet claims\nthat Negroes are brutally mis\ntreated in the United States,\nwe retort with the fact that only\na single lynching occurred in the\nUnited States last year. If the\nSoviet claims that American\nfunds in a given country are\nused for unconfessable purposes\nof buying local politicos, we\nmarshal some statements to\nprove that every penny we in\nvest abroad redounds to the\neverlasting benefit of the re\ncipient state. And so on indef\ninitely, with an apparent lack\nof aggressiveness to carry this\nform of impolite warfare\nstraight to the enemy camp.\nChinks in Soviet Armor\nWe are aware\u2014or at least we\nshould be\u2014of the weaknesses\nin the Soviet armor. The chinks\nare almost daily becoming more\nevident. Yet it seems impossible\nto profit from this awareness\nand to strike straight through\nthese holes in the enemy defens\nes. It would not be amiss, per\nhaps, to suggest that we not only\ntake advantage of the known\nweaknesses but create weaknes\nses wherever possible. The\nlittle effort at Paris to present\nour own disarmament scheme\nand force the Soviet to take it\nor leave it constitutes one bit\nof evidence as to what could\nbe done a thousandfold.

It\nmay not even be diplomacy at\nall. But in this present-day\nrough, uncivilized and totally\nuncouth international world, it\nbecomes a necessity. It is neith\ner dishonest nor criminal.

Scarecely, in\nthis case. Are you going to com\npliment your student, in the\nmanner of St. Paul, on his altar\nto the Unknown God? No for\nhe has no such altar.\nSo where will you begin?\nA missionary lately returned\nfrom China has one answer, and\na most successful one in prac\ntice. You begin, he says, with\nthe virtue already precious to\nthat small Oriental heart the\nvirtue of politeness, the virtue\nof gratitude. You start with the\nduty of thanking those who have\nbenefited us.\nDeo Gratia*\nYour pupil, coming of a race\ntha^ is almost ferociously polite,\nhas already learned to thank\nhis teachers, his parents, his\nvery ancestors for what they\nhave bestowed on him. He may\nhave thanked the last for the\ngift of life itself. But has he\nthanked anybody for the things\nthat make life beautiful sun\nlight and breezes and the pleas\nant splosh of slanting rain on\nthe rice-fields? If not, why not?\nHis thrifty heart has already\nlearned that things have their\nprice: they are either bought or\npresented. The most lovely\nthings of the world are free\n(words immemorialized by a\nnightclub singer of the \u201920\u2019s who\nneed not enter into your disser\ntation). Who gave them to us as\nfree gifts? Whoever He is who\nmade the daylight and the dusk\nHe should be thanked, from\nmere civility, for each such daily\ngift.\nThe immense advantage of\nsuch a starting place, according\nto the missioners who have used\nit, is that it immediately in\ntroduces the youngster to the\nnecessary habit of prayer\nto His Creator and prayer of a\nvery high order which, in his\nspiritual life, he need never out\ngrow.\nFor the prayer that little\nWang or Chin is uttering it iden\ntical with that glad-hearted\n\u201cDeo gratias!\u201d that members of\nthe merry monastic orders of\nthe Church shout as they awaken\nin their cells. The small Christ\nian-to-be begins to practice daily\nthankfulness to God for the\nthings he sees and feels. Then\nhe can be led on to learn how\nmany unguessed things he may\nbe thankful for, as well. He\nwill learn his debt to Our Lord\nfor those beautiful posthumous\ngifts He left us known as the\nSacraments.\nTrials as Gift*\nChinese Catholics introduced\nto the Faith by this route see\nall living as a loving exchange\nbetween God and his children,\nwhom he will not leave bereft\nof what they need. When a\nhard-pressed Chinese student\nasks, \u201cHow shall I eat if I did\nnot join the Communists who\ncontrol all the rice and issue all\nfood cards?\u201d the missionary can\nask, \u201cDid you eat yesterday?\nYes? Did you say thanks for\nthat, or think is was your due?\nThe same God who fed you last\nnight will not abandon you now.\u201d\nSometimes, in such times of\npersecution as the present, the\nLoving God sends trials as gifts,\nand even martyrdoms: but mar\ntyrs become saints only insofar\nas they believe in and cherish\nthe Love that has chosen glory\nfor them instead of slothful ease.\nBut many of the small Chinese\nboys who learned to look up at\nthe sky and say a simple, \u201cThank\nYou,\u201d as their first prayer have\npassed on up the grades to the\npost-graduate step of bearing\nwitness to the Faith: they are\nwilling martyrs todaj.\nSome of us are consistent beg\ngars at the altar.

And it has this\nvirtue, as a habit: that it forces\nus to count the numerous bless\nings of every hour which might,\notherwise, be forgotten in an\nunlovely toll of the miseries or\ndeprivations from which we\nthink that we are suffering.\nDeo gratias!"}, {"title": "evening star.", "city": ["Washington"], "date": "19570624", "raw_text": "DAVID LAWRENCE\nPresident's Chance of a Lifetime\nVote on Hells Canyon Viewed as Proving\nDemocrats Are Party of State Socialism\nPresident Elsenhower has the\nchance of a lifetime In the\npolitical arena\u2014to make a\nfight for private enterprise\nand brand the Democratic\nParty as the party of state\nsocialism In America today.\nFor the President can cite\nthe latest vote In the Senate\non the Hells Canyon project.\nThis shows that 43 out of 49\nDemocrats were recorded as\nwilling to use taxpayers\u2019 money\nto put the Government further\ninto the electric light and\npower business at a cost which\nSenator Watkins of Utah has\nestimated would run up to\nabout $2,225,000,000 in the\nnext fifty years.

STOKES\nRosy Outlook for Civil Rights\nNixon-Knowland Rivalry Among Factors\nSeen Indicating Senate Passage of Bill\nIt seems safe now to fore\ncast that a civil rights bill\nalong lines of that sponsored\nby the Eisenhower administra\ntion, which has been approved\nby the House, will this time\novercome, at long last, the age\nold traditional hurdle and also\npass the Senate.\nThat will give the President\nand his party a big victory in\nthe field of civil rights. That\nin turn will have its political\npotency.\nWhatever the outcome of\nthe current maneuvering over\nprocedure\u2014that is, how the\nmeasure will get to the Senate\nfloor\u2014it seems certain of get\nting there in this session. There\nIt will, of course, encounter a\nsure filibuster. But now Re\npublicans and Northern Demo\ncrats Indicate the will to break\nthe filibuster, which has been\nmissing in recent year*, and\nthe will is all that is needed.\nThat coalition has the votes.\nAnyone trained In Judging\nthe atmosphere of the Senate\ncan now sense a new determi\nnation among Republican lead\ners that has an Inevitability\nabout it. Along with this con\nfidence, you can detect a con\ntrasting spirit of defeatism and\ndesperation among the back\nto-the-wall Southern Demo\ncrats who are fighting what\nseems to be a losing delaying\naction.\nIn seeking the reasons for\npredicted Republican success\nthis year you find three factors\nthat are very Influential.\nOne Is that the two top Rt\npublican leaders in the Senate\n\u2014Vice President Nixon and\nSenate Leader Knowland\u2014are\nboth running as hard as they\ncan for President. Each is\ndoing everything he can for\ncivil rights legislation to identi\nfy himself and his party with\na cause and an issue that\ncounts heavily in big urban\nAmerica, it is just as logical\nfor the Federal Government to\ntake over and operate the steel,\ncopper, coal, oil, aluminum\nand other natural resource in\ndustries as well as automobiles,\nfood, and retail stores, rail\nroads, buslines, airlines, and\nall the other businesses now\nhandled by private enterprise\nand private investors.\nA statistical case doubtless\ncan be made for Government\nownership and operation in\neach instance on the ground\nthat the Government could do\nit all more cheaply\u2014since no\ntaxes, local or otherwise, would\nhave to be paid directly out of\nincome. The taxpayers gener\nally would be asked to foot\nthe bill. Private incentive\nwould be destroyed. Millions\nof workers, moreover, on be\ncoming Government employes,\nwould have to give up their\nlabor union privilege of using\neconomic power in negotia\ntions for wages. The postal\nemployes could give some idea\nfrom their experience as to\nwhat that means to the work\ners.\nThe advocates of Govern\nment ownership always start\noff with some benevolent and\nhigh-sounding objective. In\nthe Tennessee Valley project\njust after World War I they\npromised flood control and\nnavigation advantages in the\nTennessee River and benefits\nto the farmer. Electric power,\nthey insisted, was to be inci\ndental. Today it is the main\nbusiness of TV A and the Gov\nernment has been compelled to\nappropriate money for steam\nplants since about half of the\npower generated at TVA comes\nfrom coal and not dams. Priv\nate utilities in the area have\nbeen weakened and some put\nout of business altogether.\nThe Federal Power Com\nmission surveyed the whole\nHells Canyon project and\nMr. Humphrey had begun by\ncontending that the Eisen\nhower administration policies\nhad brought the country un\nparalleled prosperity, curbed\ninflation, reduced spending and\nthe public debt and in every\nway improved a dreadful her\nitage from the Roosevelt-Tru\nman administrations.\nThese all-embracing claims\nand his persistence in equating\nMr. Eisenhowers peacetime\ntasks with the war years of\nMr. Roosevelt and Mr. Truman\nwere too much even for his\nclose friend, Senator Byrd of\nVirginia.\nSenator Byrd, chairman of\nthe investigation, moved into\nthe extremely novel-for-him\nposition of defender of the\nDemocratic Presidents and de\nflator of Mr. Eisenhower and\nMr. Humphrey. Senator Byrd\nconcluded that \u201cthe Nation\nis skating on very thin ice.\u201d\nEven so. he spoke more in\nsorrow than in anger. Senator\nKerr took off the gloves.\nNoting Republican charges\nthat the investigation wa* be \u25a0\ning conducted in a political\natmosphere. Senator Kerr\npromised to maintain that at\nmosphere. He called Mr. Hum\nphrey's statement \"G. O. P.\ncampaign ammunition\u201d and\nhe moved into a point-by\npoint refutation of its \"errors\nand misstatements.\u201d\nSenator Kerr demonstrated\ncenter*. They have what\nmight be called a mutually\nprotective alliance on last\nissue.\nAnother reason for the\nfavorable situation of Repub\nlicans in the Senate is that\nthe issue has been simplified\nby concentrating on one basic\nlight and the protection of\nthat\u2014the right to vote. This\navoids other confusing and\nemotional issues, such as. for\nexample, the now burning in\ntegration issue, as well as is\nsues which Republican and\nNorthern Democrats formerly\ntied into civil rights measures.\nThese include the Fair Em\nployment Practices Act. the\nFEPC so deplored in the South;\na Federal antilynching bill,\nand repeal of the poll tax as\na prerequisite for voting as it\nstill is in six Southern States.\nThis strategy of concentra\nting largely on the right to\nvote is credited to Attorney\nGeneral Herbert Brownell, who\nis a shrewd (iolitlcal strate\ngist. The bill, too. is certainly\n\"moderate.\" as President Ei\nsenhower described it in this\nweek's news conference.\nIt is hard to attack a bill i\ndesigned to protect the right\nto vote and arouse much sym\npathy for such an attitude. In L\nrecent years, as a matter of\nfact, the South has been point\ning proudly to a gradual ex\ntension of the franchise among i\nNegroes as an advance in 1\ncivil rights, even though, as ,\nstatistics show, there are still \\\nsome areas where Negro voting I\nIs almost nil. The Negro vote ,\nwas substantial enough in some I\nSouthern cities in last Novem\nber's election, however, to cause j\npoliticians, both South and <\nNorth, both Democrat and Re- 1\npublican, to pause and ponder, I\nespecially the sl/ablQ defer)ion \u2019\nto President Eisenhower which (\nwas enough in at least one 1\nfound that the three smaller\ndams which the private com\npanies have been granted a\nlicense to build would furnish\nall the electric power required\nand do all the flood control\nwork that is needed. Private\ninvestors would supply the\nmoney. Now this opportunity\nwould be taken away.\nThe public power advocates\nwon the fight because of some\nnew-found allies from the\nSouthern part of the United\nStates. Republican Senators\nare saying openly that the\nDemocratic leadership ma\nnipulated a deal whereby some\nNorthern Democrats agreed to\nsupport the South in a parlia\nmentary maneuver the other\nday to keep the \"civil rights\u2019*\nbill in the Judiciary Commit\ntee. In exchange for this\u2014\nwhich turned out to be futile\nanyway as the Northern \u201clib\nerals\u201d had enough votes to\nbeat the maneuver\u2014several\nSoutherners agreed to vote for\nthe Hells Canyon project. In\nfive instances this meant a\nreversal of Democratic votes\nrecorded a year ago\u2014enough\nto beat the measure if they\nhad stood firm against state\nsocialism.\nThese are not happy days in\nWashington for those who be\nlieve in the historic American\nsystem of private enterprise.\nThis system built our un\nunrivalled Industrial capacity\nand today is the Nation\u2019s real\ndefense against a powerful\nenemy. Khrushchev, the Com\nmunist spokesman, predicted\nthree weeks ago in his televi\nsion interview that the grand\nchildren of the present gen\neration in the United States\nwould be living under \u201csocial\nism.\" Maybe he is away off\nin his dates but some form of\nGovernment ownership of key\nindustries in America may be\nnearer than anyone nowadays\nthinks if the Democratic Party\n\u2014numerically the majority\nparty in the Nation today\u2014\ncontinues to embrace state so\ncialism.\nKIChU **MTTt4>\nthat nondefense spending had\nsteadily risen under President\nEisenhower. He insisted that\nthe only fair spending com\nparisons were between Pres\nident Truman's nonwar year*\nand Mr. Eisenhower's.\nMr. Humphrey has said that\nrecurrence of inflation is due\nto consumer demand. Sena\ntor Kerr offered tables show\ning there were no real short\nages in the present economy.\nEconomists In the audience\nwere giving Mr. Kerr most of\nthe points when the exchange\nmoved into the hard money\npolicy. \u201cNeither one knows\nwhat they are talking about\nnow,\u201d exclaimed one earnest\nexpert.\nIt Is. of course, notoriously\ndifficult to translate any\nthing except the most ele\nmental economic facts into\ncampaign currency. It is felt\nby Democrats, however, that\nif anyone can do it Senator\nKerr, a gifted phrase-maker,\ncan.\nWhat Mr. Kerr also plainly\nhopes to do is to chivy the\nTreasury Secretary into an\nother \u201chair curling\u201d outburst\nsuch as the one on spending\nwhich brought so much\nbudget trouble to President\nEisenhower in its wake. Mr.\nHumphrey is used to consider\nable deference; Senator Kerr\nIs by turns negligent, be\nlittling. scoffing. It makes a\ngood show and Is well attended.\nState to account for the margin\nof the President's victory In\ncarrying that State again.\nThat was Tennessee.\nNobody says anything in de\nbate in Congress about the\npossible future effect of the\nSouthern Negro vote on poli\ntical leaders of the old school\nwho have dramatized them\nselves by fighting civil rights\nmeasures\u2014but it Is suspected\nthat this is a factor in the\ndepressed spirits of some\nSouthern members of Congress.\nA third factor improving the\noutlook for civil rights legisla\ntion is that this is an issue\nupon which the Republican\nParty in Congress can Join al\nmost unanimously. Such soli\ndarity on an issue that will be\nprominent during the rest of\nthis session will help to divert\nattention from divisions In the\nparty on other issues. At the\nsame time, civil rights Is the\nissue that divides the Demo\ncratic Party most sharply. It\nis to the advantage of Repub\nlicans to keep it constantly to\nthe fore and thus keep before\nthe public the picture of the\nDemocratic Party in a noisy\nand nasty family qurfrrel.\nThis Is clearly the Intention\nof the two California presiden\ntial aspirants\u2014Messrs.

There is another rea\nson which is that in recent years Re\npublican doctrine has been shaped by\ntheorists who are out of touch with\nthe modern world. Indeed, it would\nnot be an exaggeration to say that\nit has been shaped by theorists who\ndo not know what they are talking\nabout.\nThese theorists have produced a\nformula which discombobulates\nRepublican thinking. It is that lib\neralism and progressivism are the\nhigh road to socialism, and that\nsocialism is the high road to com\nmunism.\nThe extremists use the formula to\nsay that the United States started\ndown the road to communism when\nthe income tax was legalized in 19x3.\nBut even the moderates, General Ei\nsenhower, for example, are deeply |\nsuspicious of social security and the\nwelfare state and of aid to education, |\nand above all of the modern concep\ntion of the compensatory economy.\nThe difficulty about making a new I\nimage is that the Republican theorists\nhave created such a false image of\nthe Kennedy Democratic party that\nthere is no effective way they can\noppose it. Applied to the Kennedy\nAdministration the formula of the\ntheorists of the right, that progres\nsivism leads to socialism and social\nism to communism, is absurd. It is\nsilly. Though Kennedy is a progres\nsive and a liberal, he is also a pro\nfound conservative, and only the be\nfuddled theorists find that strange\nand hard to understand.\nTheir central theme, which is\nalso a central illusion, is that this\ncountry is \"spending\" its way out\nof freedom into socialism and com\nmunism. But is it? I have some\nfigures here which come from Prof.\nF. M. Bator, a leading authority\non the problems of government\nspending.\nA big rich country spends more, I\nof course, than a small poor country,\nThe proper basis of comparison,\ntherefore, is the volume of govern\nment spending against the size of the\neconomy.

In West\nGermany the latest figures are for\n1957. That was before the big rise\nof German defense spending and\nat that time the percentage of pub\nlic spending was slightly bigger\nthan ours (28.6 per cent).\nYet West Germany is regarded by\nmany as the shining example of a\nfree capitalistic economy.\nBut, it will be said, while defense\nspending is necessary, the real creep\ning socialism is the money spent for\nsocial security, veterans' benefits,\ngovernment interest, and cash subsi\ndies. For the United States the ratio\nof such payments to gross national\nproduct was 7 per cent in 1959.\nThe Canadian ratio was 8.7 per\ncent. The United Kingdom's ratio\nwas 11.2 per cent. The West German\n(in 1957) was 12.1 per cent, the\nBelgium 13.6 per cent, the French\n16.5 per cent.\nThere are other comparative fig\nures which could be cited.\nAll of them point to the conclus\nion that as compared with the ad\nvanced industrial nations of the\nworld the ratio of our public spend\ning is conservative.\nThere is no hard factual basis for\nthe theory that we have turned our\nback on the free economy and are'\non th\u00ae high road to socialism and\ngan a da does not work for the very\nsimple reason that it is not true,\ncommunism.\nThe latter-day Republican propa\n^\nHydro Development In -\n\u2014from page 2\n\"Now, there are many who will\nargue, and 1 have heard many\nargue for the past several years,\nthat these figure* indicate hydro\nelectric power is now longer as im\nportant to the nation's needs as it\nonce was and that our overwhelm\ning dependence on thermal genera\ntion has minimized the value of\nhydro site* and hydro development*\nin any national power plan.

With all of the\ncertainty of youth, you assert the\nsuperiority, in accord with the genius\nthe Constitution, of State power\nas against Federal powers. I seem to\nremember that a hundred years ago\nit was State powers which guarded\nand perpetuated the institution of\nchattel slavery, and that it was Fed\nfn\u00fc power alone that destroyed this\ninstitution of complete denial of\nfreedom. And, I also remember that\nFederal power alone was able to wipe\n\u00b0ff the books of the most vociferous\n\u00b0f th\u00ae States now asserting the sac\nredness of State power, such infamous\nlaws as the Black Codes, which even\nin 1865, after 4 years of costly Civil\nWar, still made it a capital offense\nto teach a black man to read and\nwrite.\n\"A* I read my country's history,\nevery major subsequent advance\nmade since the legal extinction of\nslavery by Federal enactment, and\naimed to remove its odious rem\nnants in law and practice, has re\nquired the use of Federal power.\n\"As a trades unionist, I certainly\nknow that every major advance in\nmy lifetime, in freedom from want\nand economic oppression of the peo\nple who earn their bread with their\ndaily labor, has been by the exercise\nof Federal power, frequently not\nonly at the expense of, but, as in the\ncase of slavery, over the bitter oppo\nsition of State powers.\nFEDERAL POWER ENDED\nVIRTUAL INDUSTRIAL SLAVERY\nBefore you or most of your mem\nbers were born, I lived and worked in\nthis country when there was no pro\ntection against the arbitrary will of\nan employer or his foreman, whose\npower over the economic life of the\nworkmen was so great Chief Justice\n* .\nI Taft once declared that the very tone\nof voice, independent of the words\nused by the master to his workmen,\n( could constitute intimidation.

At least\ntwo of them spent long years for\nwarding the Communist cause in lit\nerature, in teaching and in labor,\nwhile organized elements, like my\nunion and myself, were fighting that\nCommunist offensive, including their\npart in it. These are high-grade intel\nlects and they are properly welcomed\nii\nback to freedom's side. But they, in\nall proper humility, might well refrain\nfrom lecturing organized labor in\nsuch patronizing tones, as John Do*\nPassos and Dr. Bella Dodd have un\npardonly done, to those who only a\nfew years ago were holding the line\nagainst the Communists, while Dos\nPassos and Dr. Dodd, in communism's\nera of much greater domestic strength\nthan now, were passing up the am\nmunition to our Communist foe.\n\"Capt.

I have never heard Mr.\nRickenbacker repudiate that wartime\nnonsense and may I be forgiven for\ndoubting if he has even understood\nthe nature of freedom here, except\nan anarchiac, selfish individual part\nof it, which is no guide for you and\nme, any better than he understood\nwhat he saw in Soviet Russia in war\ntime.\n\"I will not send you money, since\nthe men you sponsor as speakers\nand their supporter* didn't seem\nto need it the last time I looked.\nI do send you much more valuable\nadvise, and the cost of time, brain\nsweat and effort to a boy merely\neducated in tax-supported Phila\ndelphia schools and the hard col\nlege of the labor movement, is so\nconsiderable, that I feel like a very\ngenerous man.\"\nMontana Cattle\nCount Down\nHELENA\u2014As numbers of cattle\nadvanced nationally to a record high\nas of January 1, Montana dropped in\nrank and the mid-continent states\ngained.

Little imagination is\nneeded to fathom the purpose o,\nthis deception. And as the 1956\nelections approach it must be ex\npected that these endeavors will\naccelerate.\nThat the political philosophy ol\nthe New-Fair Deal, with its many\n| socialistic tendencies, has beer,\nj capably \u201cshorn of its glory\u201d,\nthere can be no argument. But\nthese recurring efforts at resur\nrection give rise to the impres\nsion that the real meaning, intent\nand consequences of socialism arc\nnot generally understood.\nWebsters New International\ni Dictionary defines socialism as \u201cA\npolitical and economic theory ol\nsocial organization based on col\nlective or governmental owner\nship and democratic management\nof the essential means for the pro\nduction and distribution of goods\n. . . socialism aims to replace com\npetition by cooperation, and profit\nseeking by social service, and to\ndistribute income and social op\nportunity more equitably than\nthey are now believed to be dis\ntributed.\u201d\nTo expose and illuminate the\nfallacy of socialism, we have only\nto examine the wretched record\nof Ihe British Labor government j\nin taking over or nationalizing the !\ncoal, transportation and steel in j\ndustries shortly after World War\n11.

The consumer\nis the one who pays. Every time a consumer of light\nor power pays his bill to the private power company\nhe is contributing a portion of the taxes which they\neventually get credit for paying simply because it is\nthe Power Company's check which makes its appear\nance in the county or city treasurer's office and on\nhis records.\nAnother argument put forth by opponents of\nPublic Power or Government operation is that our\ntaxes go to pay for these government dams.\nThis is distinctly fallacious. Construction (imme\ndiate construction that is) is taken care of by long\nterm bonds which are paid off from and by the reve\nnues from the sale of the power.\nBut even if that statement were factual the logic\nwould still be unsound for as I said recently to a man\nwho used this argument. 'Suppose your taxes, or your\nmoney did pay the cost of construction of government\nbuilt dams, your money as a consumer also paid the\ncost of the privately constructed dams and even after\nthey are paid for you still continue paying and you\nnever own the plants. Why not then, pay for the gov\nernment construction and own your share in it?\" \"But,\"\nhe replied, \"I am not the government\". If so, that is\nyour own fault. We have what purports to be a democ\nracy in which every voter has the privilege of voicing\nhis sentiment and choice of public servants and if he\nis to indolent or apathetic to do so or give thoughtful\ncare to his selection, where lies the blame?\nAnother (and to many a rather meaningless argu\nment) is that government operation is \"Creeping\nSocialism\".\nThis argument is palpably little more than a smoke\nscreen thrown up to obscure the facts and is hardly\nworthy of argument in opposition for if the truth is\nknown, about eighty per cent of our American citizens\ndo not know what socialism really is and many who\nthink they know and will attempt to define socialism\nwill give a definition which they have accepted from\nsome one else and often from some one who knows\neven less than they themselves. The general public\nidea of socialism is extremely vague and the term\nis used simply to frighten an uncertain public. The\nimportant thing for us to consider is whether or not\ngovernment operation is more advantageous econom\nically and socially than private operation, and if logic\nand the facts show that it is, then we want it regard\nless of by what name it may be called.\nNow we come to an important question. Can pub\nlic operation (government or municipal) be success\nful economically and socially?\n$112,161 To Be Distributed To\nCounties In Land Use Funds\nMISSOULA\u2014Treasurers of twenty\ncounties in Montana and western\nNorth and South Dakota will soon re\nceive checks from the Treasurer of\nthe United States totaling $225,064.\n43, or twenty-five per cent of the net\nreceipts from eleven Land Utilization\nProjects administered by the North\nern Region of the U. S. Forest Serv\nice, according to Regional Forester\nCharles L. Tebbe.\nOf the total amount, $112,161\u2014or\nabout 50 per cent\u2014will be distributed\nto 10 Montana counties in Eastern\nMontana.\nIn making the announcement re\ngarding the payment of funds from\nLU land receipts, Regional Forester\nTebbe said that these rehabilitated\nsubmarginal lands, totaling approxi\nmately 3,126,000 acres in the North\nern Region, were put under federal\nmanagement in the 1930's by Title\nIII of the Bankhead-Jones Farm Ten\nant Act. During 1956 the lands\nbrought $903,857.80 into the federal\ntreasury, nearly 29% more than in\n1955. The increase is due primarily\nto increased mineral leasing activity\nin the past year. Heretofore, grazing\nhas been the principle source of in\ncome, but in 1956 minerals took the\nlead to produce approximately 62%\nof the total revenue from these LU\nlands.\nAccording to Mr. Tebbe, the lands\nare being managed with the co-opera\ntion of 31 local grazing districts and\nassociations. Total income from the\nlands in 1956 from grazing use was\n$324,597.27; and from mineral use,\nprincipally oil and gas lease rentals,\nwas $561,893.87. Miscellaneous uses,\nincluding haying, cropping, forest\nproducts and easements, accounted\nfor the remaining income, amounting\nto about 2% of the total.\nThe law providing for these pay\nments to counties earmarks the money\nfor the benefit of public schools and\nroads within the counties in which\nthe LU land is situated.\nOpponents claim that it cannot, that it is wasteful\nand more costly. At this point we can cite the operation\nof the Tennessee Valley Authority as a success on\nnationwide scale and we need not go into detail since\nits achievements and accomplishments are generally\nknown. Likewise the operations of the Port of New\nYork Athuority furnish another example of public\noperation on a national scale. But to answer the argu\nment that opponents of public operation put forth that\npublic operation is inefficient and uneconomical I want\nto cite an example of public operation on a much\nsmaller scale; an example which will also refute the\nallegation of \"creeping socialism\", namely the city of\nChanute, Kansas, a city which to the best of my knowl\nedge and belief has never had a socialist administra\ntion.\nNO CITY TAXES\nIn 1931 as a member of the Montana legislature\nreceived the information that Chanute, Kansas (then\na city of about ten thousand population) owned its own\ngas, water and electric plants and that it levied no\ncity taxes, the entire expense of the city government\nbeing paid from the revenue from these plants. Not\nbeing content to accept the source of my information\nas final I wrote to the then city clerk of Chanute for\nverification and found my information to be correct\nin that the entire cost of the city administration was\npaid by the revenue from these three municipally\nowned plants, no city taxes were levied, rates of the\nthree utilities were comparable to rates in any town\nof similar size in Kansas and that in addition to\nprevious information the city had built a $400,000\ncivic auditorium, a $400,000 hospital and a $250,000\nlibrary.\nmy\nSince I had been out of touch for several years I\nwrote again on May fourth of this year inquiring if\nthis system was still in operation and satisfactory and\nreceived an answer from the City Manager and I quote:\n\"The City of Chanute still owns the gas, water and\nelectric plants and levies no city tax-the expenses\nof operating the city government are still paid from\nthe profits of these plants. There have been several\nadditions and expansions at the electric plant and\nalso at the water plant in the past several years; also\nthree additional parks have been acquired and de\nveloped since you knew about the City and the\nfourth park has also been improved with swimming\npool and monkey island and additional tennis courts.\npark is a lighted fountain and lake and\ndeer pen. An armory building is now being con\nstructed. Many new homes have been built and sev\neral new home additions are now being developed.\nOUR UTILITY RATES ARE COMPARABLE TO\nANY TOWN OF SIMILAR SIZE IN KANSAS,\" end\nof quote. (My emphasis.)\nThe above gives an indication of what can be ac\ncomplished by public operation where citizens take an\nactive interest in choosing honest sincere public of\nficials who are competent and have the public and\ncivic interest at heart. I am positive that no one will\nassert that Chanute, Kansas or for that matter any\ntown in Kansas is \"a hotbed of socialism\nAnd so allegation of \"creeping socialism\" is seen\nfor what it is, a bugaboo thrown up to frighten\nunenlightened public.\nt\nan\nThe final, and by far the most serious\ntion of the opponents of public operation (of\nallega\npower\nor any other public function) is that such operation\nor control will lead to dictatorship.\nTo that allegation there can be only one answer.\nDictatorship can only become possible in a democracy\nsuch as ours if and when a majority of its citizens\nbecome so indolent or apathetic as to permit a small\nminority to usurp control. So long as American citizens\nhave the franchise and exercise it thoughtfully and\nintelligently the establishment of a dictatorship is im\npossible.\nMSU Resource\n(Continued from Pajee One)\nAgriculture, Washington, D.

The biggest complaint\nagainst the Communists now\nIs that they are not providing\na higher standard of living, so\nthe Party has plenty of incen\ntive.\nIs the popular pressure\nenough to make the Party relax\non doctrine and let in what\never amount of private enter\nprise Poland usefully can ab\nsorb? Which will give way,\ndoctrinaire Socialism or rapid\nprogress?\nProbably not even the Com\nmunists know the answers, but\nIt is interesting to note that\nsince the October revolution,\nthe new government already\nhas admitted some private en\nterprise by the back door while\nmaintaining a firm Marxist\nfront.\nThis is encouraging flexibil\nity. But to build the economy\nthe government also will need\ntime and stability. These can\ncome only from the patience of\nthe Polish people and from a\nlessening of world tensions.\nBefore looking at what\u2019s good\nand what\u2019s bad about the Pol\nish economy, it is useful to re\ncite some recent history which\nindicates that the economic\nmess here cannot be blamed\nentirely on communism.\nBefore World War I, Poland\nwas partitioned by Germany.\nAustria and Russia, and her\neconomy was drained by these\ncountries. Between wars Po\nland sad inflation, then depres\nsion and then a capitalism\nWhich was run on behalf of a\nsmall privileged class. During\nWorld War n. Germany and\nRussia ravaged the country,\nkilling six million Poles and\nleveling cities. ,\ni After the war the Russians\ncontinued to suck the nation\nfry. The little remaining pri\nvate industry and trade was\ndkushed.\n\u201c Starting with nothing, the\ncountry pulled itself up im\npressively in a reconstruction\nboom that accompanied the\nfirst three-year plan, 1947-49.\nThe subsequent six-year plan\nwas also reasonably effective\n\u2022 But with the postwar boom\nended, the current flve-year\nplan is lagging. Industrial ex\npansion is leveling off.\nSo the Poles have seen their\neconomy ruined by forces\nhaving nothing to do with 1\nSocialism and then partially\nrevived by a combination of\nreconstruction boom and Stal\ninist Socialism\u2014the kind of\nsocialism that is applied wlthi\nA heavy whip.\nSince October the Commu\nnists here have given up the I\nWhip.\nTwo Major Problems\nHow does Marxism fare ini\nan atmosphere of freedom?\nNbt too well. There are two\nmajor problems:\nFirst, Poland lacks the ma\nterial Ingredients of a pros\nperous economy\u2014an industrial\nbase, skilled workers, invest\nment capital, raw materials,\netc.\u2014and neither Marxists nor\nfiybody else could produce\nem quickly.\nSecond, basic human prob\nlems remain unsolved\u2014prob\nluns of incentive, of bureau\ncratic red tape, of planning in\nadequacies. of public Impatience\nand anti-Communlsm. These\nare problems which could best\nbe solved through capitalism.\nMost interesting are the hu\ntean problems. Here is what\nPolish socialism is faced with:\nFirst, the problem of incen\ntives. No way has been found\nto induce people to work efflci-\nCtotly. The government gave up\nthe terror Incentive after last\nPear\u2019s uprising but it has not\nfound an adequate substitute.\nIn a capitalist country the\nmanagers work for bigger prof\nits. the employes work for\nhigher pay. Both work out of\na sense of pride, of personal '\naccomplishment and personal\nownership.\n* In Poland under socialism\nthere are no real profits for\nthe managers to work for. Em\nployes\u2019 pay U low and the gov\nernment cannot afford to pay\nmore. And anyhow there are\n\u2022o goods to be bought if wages\ndid go up. People have little\npride In their state jobs, and\nno opportunity for ownership\nof > home or business.\nArtificial Incentives\nThe state tries to create arti\nficial incentives. It arbitrarily\ndesignates a profit in a factory\nand distributes the money\namong the men. It offers\nbonuses for extra work. It pays\nworkers on the basis of the\nnumber of pieces produced. It\ngives prizes and medals for\nheroic labor for the state.\nBut none of these things\nwork. Though the artificial\n\"profits\u201d system seems to be\ncoming closest to success, it\npresents problems. The work\ners don\u2019t like bonuses or phoney\nprofits: they want pay increase\nthey can count on. Piece rates\nboost production but stimulate\nwaste, which Poland cannot\nafford. Workers are perfectly\naware of the difference between\na medal and a new icebox.\nWhat Poles say they really\nneed for incentives are a higher\nwage scale and more goods for\nthe people to buy. The country\nhas no chance of getting either\nfor some years.\nIt is discouraging, inciden\ntally, to note that in the coal\nmining industry where the re\ngime is trying out higher pay\nscales and a special program\nof import of consumer goods\nfor the miners, production in\nthe last months has fallen off.\nThe party says \"special atten\ntion must be paid to the prob\nlem of work discipline\u201d there.\nAnother problem for the\nplanners who plan incentives\nis the basic anti-communism\nof the Poles. They Just do not\nfeel like working for a Com\nmunist government\u2014the only\nemployer\u2014unless the fruits of\ntheir labor are tasty and are\ndelivered immediately.\nAfter the problems of incen-!\ntive, there is the problem of j\nplanning. It is an article of |\nfaith among party officials that\nthe economy must be planned,\nnot permitted to follow the\nnatural course of a free mar\nket. But human beings just\naren\u2019t smart enough to plan\neverything. Details are too nu\nmerous. variable factors too\nunpredictable, human nature\ntoo mysterious and bad plans,\nonce adopted, are too difficult\nto change.\nTrying Compromise\nThe Poles are trying a com\npromise. They are reducing\ncentral, long-range planning\nby spreading the burden among\nregional officials and by being\nless rigid about the future.\nThey also are trying to plan\nless, to supervise closely just\nthe major economic forces andj\nlet the chinks fill themselves, j\nBut these improvements are,\nnot enough. The Polish econ\nomy is still rigid, lop-sided,\nbackward and top heavy.\nEven with the best \"human\nengineering,\u201d the Poles still\nwould lack the vital material\ningredients of success.\nThey lack, to begin with,\nanything approaching an ade\nquate industrial base. A nation\ncannot build Iceboxes until it\nbuilds the factories and tools\nwith which to make them.\nPoland lacks real industry, and\nit still must Invest money and\nlabor in building this industrial\nbase\nBut it not only must build\na consumer goods industry to\nsatisfy the impatient Poles, it\nalso must build heavy industry\nin order to produce more arms,\nmore machine tools, more trac\ntors, more locomotives and\nmore mining machinery.\nTo build that base, Poland\nmust have skilled workers.\nThey exist today in pitifully\nsmall numbers. It takes years,\nof course, to train a good lathe\noperator. Poland has only a\nstart on a training program.\nA final ingredient of success,\nlargely lacking here, is capital.\nPoland not only has no private\ncapital upon which to build\nsome useful free-enterprise in\ndustry. but it lacks State cap\nital with which to build State\nindustry. If there were more\nwealth in Poland the workers\ncould be paid more and foreign\ngoods could be purchased. The\ncapital will have to be accumu\nlated\u2014slowly.\nFinally, there is the shortage\nlof vital raw material. Poland\nis a rich farming country and\nhas extensive coal and sulphur\ndeposits. But many basic raw\nmaterials must be imported\nThat costa money, which\nPoland doesn't have.\nAfter this gloomy recitation\nit is pleasant to be able to\npoint out some bright spots in'\nthe Polish economy.\nMost important it that the\ngovernment since October has\nshown mors and more flexlbil\n\\\nity in its approach to economic\nproblems. In theoiy this must\nstop short of giving up Social\nist goals, but. in fact it comes\nto choosing between the letter\nof Marxist doctrines and cer\ntain variations tending toward\ncapitalism. Party leaders have\ntold this reporter, in effect, that\nthey were in favor of whatever\nworks.\nThey insist capitalism won\u2019t\nwork, but they are encouraging\nprivate enterprise on the farms\nand in some manufacturing\nand trade.\nThe lid has been raised cnly\na fraction of an inch in the\ncities. Free enterprise so far\nis mostly the fly-by-night va\nriety. But, given a fair chance,\nsmall private factories and\nshops might well contribute to\nthe Polish economy and also\nshow the government that mod\nern free enterprise does not re\nsult in either anarchy or en\nslavement of the workers.\nAnother encouraging step\nwas taken in January when\nfactory workers were permitted\nto organize councils which help\nthe management with labor\nproblems. In Yugoslavia such\ncouncils are actually running\nsome factories, and they do a\nbetter job than did the central\nplanners.\nForeign Aid Helps\nForeign aid also is helping\nPoland. The United States will\nprovide some $93 million in\nloans and cheap farm goods.\nFrance, Chechoslovakia and\nEast Germany are also chipping\nin. while other countries show\ninterest.\nForeign trade is being redi\nrected so that Poland can buy\nand sell where it is economic\nally most advantageous, not\nwhere Communist bloc politics\ndictate.\nIndustrial priorities are being\nshifted to give the consumer a\nbetter break, although the job\nof building Poland\u2019s industrial\nbase will require concentration\non non-consumer goods for\nsome years.\nAnd so, although Poland\u2019s\nsocialist economy may be the\nonly game in town, the game\ncan be improved and modified\nsomewhat. It is no longer en\ntirely a matter of \"dealer\u2019s\nchoice.\u201d The race now will be\nbetween Communist - directed\neconomic expansion and the\npeople\u2019s impatience with their\nlow standard of living.\nA-Test Postponed\nATOMIC TEST SITE.

LOUIS 8, MO.\nDistrict Clerk Exposes\nGarnishment Abuses\nContinued from First Page\nHere are some of the credit\nstore tactics he will swear to:\n. Confession of Judgment\u2014\nThis is a paper signed by a\ndebtor admitting that the debt\nis due and payable. If a cus\ntomer can be induced to sign it\nwhen he makes his purchase,\nthe store has an easier time\ncollecting from him later if\nhe misses a payment.\nWhen a quick check of a\nnew customer's record indi\ncates he is a poor credit risk,\nthe store\u2014instead of refusing\nhim credit\u2014agrees to sell to\nhim if he will sign a \"confes\nsion of judgement.\u201d The cus\ntomer signs it, usually without\nknowing what it is.\nLater, if the customer misses\na payment, the store simply\nfiles a suit, fills in the court\ncase number on the form and\npresents the debtor\u2019s \"confes\nsion\" that the debt is a just\none. The court then grants a\njudgement against the debtor.\nAccording to the witness, the\nstore\u2019s attorney signs these con\nfession forms in blank, a hun\ndred or so at a time, so that\nthey will be ready when needed.\nConsent of Condemnation\u2014\nThis is another device, designed\nto get an old customer deeper\nin debt and guard the store\nagainst a plea for exemption.\n(The law exempts from garn\nishment S2OO of a debtor's sal\nary per month if he is the\nhead of a house, or S6O if he\nis single. But the exemption\nis not automatic; it has to be\nclaimed.)\nWhen a customer falls be\nhind in his payments to the\nstore and finds that his salary\nhas been attached, he may visit\nthe store to try to get some of\nhis money released. The store,\ninstead of agreeing to give him\na chance to get out of debt,\npersuades him to buy more\nmerchandise. But to buy more,\nhe must sign a \"consent of\ncondemnation,\" which author\nizes the debtor\u2019s employer to\nrelease his money to the cred\nitor. Now the customer is deeper\nin debt than before, and he has\nsigned away his right to any\nexemption from garnishment.\nDouble Judgment\u2014Once the\ncourt, grants a creditor a judg\nment against a debtor, the\ncreditor must file a garnish\nment notice each time he wants\nto attach the debtor\u2019s wages.\nBut often, after one attach\nment, the debtor will make\nfurther payments direct to the\nstore to avoid being garnisheed\nagain.\nIn such a case, the witness\nwill testify, the store does not\nnotify the court when the\ndebt has been paid in full. In\nstead, the store leaves the judg\nment in force. Later, if the\ndebtor buys more goods and\nfalls behind in his payments\nagain, the store files a new\ngarnishment notice based on\nthe old judgment. This relieves\nthe store of going to the.trouble\nof asking the eourt for a new\njudgment.\nPigeonholed Papers When\na creditor asks the court for a\njudgment against a debtor,\nthree copies of his motion are\nprepared\u2014one for the court,\none for the creditor and one\nfor the debtor. According to\nthe witness, the store often\nfails to mail the debtor his\ncopy of the motion. Thus the\ndebtor does not appear in\ncourt, and a judgment against\nhim is granted \u201cby default.\u201d\nOnce a judgment is granted,\na garnishment aotice is served\non the debtor\u2019s employer, who\nmust reply to it stating how\nmuch he owe\\ the debtor. If\nthe employer fails to reply, his\nown assets may be garnisheed.\nIn one case, the witness will\ntestify, the credit store\u2019s at\ntorney took an employer\u2019s an\nswer from the court clerk\u2019s of\nfice and pocketed it: the an\nswer never got into the court\nfiles. Later, the employer\nwrote the attorney, confirming\nthat he had filed his answer\nwith the court. According to\nthe witness, the attorney com\nmented: \"They\u2019ll never see this\none. This would blow our\ncase.\"\n\"Moving\u201d the Debtor\u2014The\nDistrict Code provides that if\na debtor lives outside the Dis\ntrict, the creditor can attach\nhis salary without obtaining a\ncourt judgment in advance.\nTo make it easier to attach\nthe wages of a debtor who does\nlive in the District, the witness\nsays, the store often prepares\na false account card with a\nnon-resident address. This is\npresented to the Municipal j\nCourt clerk to back up an affi\ndavit swearing that the debtor\nlives outside the District, and\nthe creditor files an \u201cattach\nment-before-judgment\u201d form\nwith the court.\nThe debtor, wno finds his\nsalary attached without any\nnotice, usually visits the store\nto try to get some of his money\nreleased, and the store per\nsuades him to sign a confession\nMi\nTHURSDAY\nNIGHT\nfrom 9:30 A.M. to 9 P.M.\n4\nThe Len ts & Thos.

A\ndebtor\u2019s appearance in court is\nso rare, the witness says, that\ncredit store attorneys usually\nare caught without their ac\ncount records and must ask for\npostponement of the case.\nBack in the store, the records\nare checked. If there is any\nthing in them that might hurt\nthe store\u2019s case, the records are\ndoctored. If necessary, a new\naccount card is prepared. Va\nrious employes make entries on\njit, and one of them crumplesi\n'and smears it to make it look!\nolder than it is.\nPerjured Testimony\u2014When\na case is contested and goes to\ntrial, the crearc store\u2019s attorney\ngives employes detailed in-\nI structions. on what to say in\ncourt, and the testimony is\nparroted back to him from the\nwitness stand,\nThe witness says he com\nmitted perjury almost every\nTHE SUNDAY STAR, Washington, D.

But he can docket this\n\"dead\" judgment in District\nCourt and obtain a new judg\nment there. The debtor still\nis entitled to his exemption,\nbut he has to claim it again.\nAccording to the witness, the,\nstore he worked for uses this\ntechnique to bully emplovers\ninto paying, telling them Dis\ntrict Court is \u201chigher\u201d than\nMunicipal Court and has\nj priority. If this doesn\u2019t work.\n! there may still be a chance to\n| collect if the debtor fails to\nclaim his exemption within the I\ntime allowed.\nFive Payday Month Still\nanother trick to get around\nthe exemption statute is to\nwait for a month that has:\nfive pay days before filing a\ngarnishment. A debtor whose\nsalary normally would be\nexempt\u2014say a man who makes i\nSSO a week\u2014would earn more\nthan '.200 in a five-payday\nmonth, and some of his wages\ncould be attached.\nMississippi Poll\nShows Only Drop\nIn Colored Voters\nBr the associated Prcsa\nATLANTA, July 20.

But as he began to |\n| see the true nature of Socialism in practice, he quit his party\nand wrote a book entitled \u201cThe Socialist Tragedy.\u201d In it he\nwarns the free world that no matter how well it is doctored |\nup in the dress of social reform, \u201cproduction for use,\u201d or wel- |\nfare state \u201ccapitalism,\u201d Socialism, over the long haul, means I\npoverty and -ultimate enslavement for a nation\u2019s people, in-\nI cluding, of course, the very ones it claims to champion\u2014the |\n[ wage earners. |\nIn his chapter on \u201cSocialism and Freedom,\u201d Thomas\n| notes that Socialism and Communism have the following three\n| main characteristics in common: (1) the communal owner- |\n\u2018ship of the means of production, distribution and exchange; |\n1 (2) the abolition of personal incomes derived from rent, |\nI profit and interest; and (3) the central planning of pro- |\n| duction. .\nl (1) \u201cWhen the private owners of property are expro- |\n| priated and the state steps into their shoes, henceforth there\n|is only one landlord and one employer,\u201d writes Thomas. \u201cA '\ni mineworker whom the National Coal Board wants to get |\n[ rid of has no possibility of again getting werk in a British\n| pit.\u201d I\nI (2) If private incomes from rent, profit and interest |\n! are abolished, as they are in Socialism and Communism, \u201cthen |\n\\I all individual incomes will be derived from the state or state \u2018\n| bodies,\u201d Thomas observes. \u201cIf the persons who control the |\nI flow from the chest decide to stop or divert it they can do so. |\n| It will be seen how precarious are the liberties of man in|\nI such a system.\u201d <\n! (3) The central planning of production, which is the |\n| heart of Socialist and Communist bureaueracy, requires the |\nIrogimontation and ultimate enslavement of the individual |\nI worker. \u201cIn Britain,\u201d writes Thomas, \u201cpersuasion was first\n| used to induce workers to go to the industries where the plan- |\nI ners wanted them to go...but the grim facts of economoic |\nII life forced the government\u2019s hand, and on 6th August 1947, |\n| Mr. Attlee told the House of Commons that the government |\n'l had decided to reimpose the control over the engagement |\nI of labour.\u201d ' |\n[ \u201cThis,\u201d writes Thomas, the onetime Labor-Socialist, \u201cis |\n; part of the tragedy of socialism.\u201d |\n\u2018lall of Swanton; three brothers,!\n\u2018| George Harvey, of near Oakland; |\nI John Harvey, Short Run, and Ar-|\n'|thur Harvey, Pomfret; two sisters,|\nLl Mrs. Lois Wilson, Ottumwa, lowa;|\nand Mrs, Belle Meyers, Short Run;l\n'1 11 grandchildren, 10 su-p-x:r:nul-i\n|| children, and a great grandcehild. !\n'I Funeral services were x'un(llh\u2018lwll\n| Saturday afternoon at 2 o'clock\nI from the Swanton Methodist!\n,I('l]tll'('h with Rev.

Benson\nB\\L \u201c PRESIDENT NATIONAL EDUCATION PROGRAM\nAR, (TR Searcy, Arkansas\nWith each new concentration of economic power in the\nfederal government\u2014now completely controlling about 20\nof the national income\u2014the long range economic future of\nthe American citizen diminishes. Concentration of economic\npower in the federal government is Socialism. This isn\u2019t an\naccusation or a charge\u2014it simply is the stating of an indis\nputable fact. And the American people need to clearly under\nstand this fact\u2014and all its implications. We must all act as\ncitizens to halt the continuing concentration of economic\npower in government.\nWe have the figures available on what Scandinavian and\nEuropean Socialism\u2014the concentration of economic power in\nthe government\u2014has brought the citizens of those nations.\nNone has full, totalitarian Socialism. Yet the citizens of those\nnations have living standards one-third to one-sixth as good\nas ours in Aimerica.\nCommunist Russia\u2019s system is total Socialism. The gov\nernment owns and controls everything. My figures have\nbeen gathered by the Assembly of Captive European Na\ntions. They may be accepted as accurate.\nIn Russia\u2019s total Socialism there are 25 people in the\nruling Polit-bureau, with Khrushchev having dictatorial con\ntrol at the moment. These 25 people have free access to the\nentire wealth of the nation. Their income is unlimited. They\nmay have any material possession they desire. Under them\nin the scale of income is the Central Committee of the Com\nmunist Party, the high government ministers, and the most\nimportant scientists and artists of value to the Party. There\nare approximately 2,000 of these. Their income ranges from\n$40,000 to $65,000 a year (converting the rubles not at the\n\u201cofficial\u201d exchange rate but to actual dollar purchasing\npower. These people have special stores containing food, deli\ncalcies from throughout the world; automobiles, yachts,\nvillas.\nThe next economic group consists of leading bureaucrats,\narmy generals, industrial managers, secret police officials\nand important scientists and artists. There are 300,000 of\nthese people. Their income ranges from $6,000 to SB,OOO a\nyear, and they too have special stores, drive government\nowned cars, and enjoy the luxury of private villas.\nThe next economic group contains civil servants, the\nparty bureaucracy, professionals\u2014doctors, lawyers, profes\nsors\u2014and stakhanovite workers (workers who have set in\ndividual production records). There are 31,000,000 in this\ngroup. Their income ranges from S6OO to S9OO a year. Be\nneath these are the wage-earners and peasants, the great\nmass of the able-bodied citizenry\u2014l6o,ooo,ooo. The average\nincome of this group is about SSOO a year. There is still a\nlower group on the economic ladder of total Socialism\u2014\nforced laborers. .. .the slaves.\nThe Assembly of Captive European Nations has esti\nmated there are 6,000,000 Russians in the slave labor camps.\nOther estimates range much higher. John Noble, who spent\n9 years as a prisoner-slave in Russia said he obtained au\nthenic information placing the number of slaves at 28,000,-\n000! Most of these get nothing but a starvation diet and\nforced labor. Some, however, are paid. In the last few months\nin Vorkuta, John Noble was paid $25 a month, but he was\nforced to pay $lB of this for room and board (in prison!) and\n$1.25 withholding tax. \u201cThose who didn\u2019t fill their \u2018norms,\u201d\u201d\nhe reports, \u201cwere paid nothing and were put on killing punish\nment rations besides.\u201d\nThis is the record of total Socialism.\nvey Winters, Harold Beckman,\nGerald Thrasher, Hayes Dignan,\nNorman Welch, Eddie Sanders.\nBetty Crocker: Jean Beachy.\nLions club award winners were\npreviously announced.

The point is\nthat after this session ends, the\nmen who officiaily run this coun\ntry, and the people as a whole in\nwhom the real power is vested, had\nbetter buckle down to the job of\nregaining control of the Federal\nfinances and curbing what now\nthreatens to become a run-away\ninflation, if codgsequances disas\ntrous to all are to be averted.\nBecause inflation is no longer a\nthreat; it is a fact.

'\n@\u2018 Listen Americans!\nt\ny \u2018 BY GEORGE 8. BENSON\n\u2019 'Q\u2018 President of Harding College\nIn his book, The Socialist Tragedy, Ivor Thomas showed\nthat in modern world history Socialism has been the transition\nstage through which Communism has come to power in nation\ndfter nation. In Russia itself the Communists helped Kerensky\nset up his Socialist Provisional Government before taking over\na short time later. In Hungary the Reds came to power after\nthey had lured the Socialist government into a coalition. In\nCzechoslovakia the Reds moved to power through the Socialist\nParty headed by Dr. Benes.\n\" At the 20th World Congress of the Communist Party held\nin Moscow recently, the same old strategy was re-emphasized\nfor the Red conspirators in all the countries outside the Iron\nCurtain: work for Socialism first; this was the order of the day.\nWith the Reds pushing behind the scene, Socialism has risen to\npower in most of the nations of the world. All thes\u00e9 extremely\nimportant facts of history are brought to the attention of high\nschool students studying World History in the course developed\nby Harding Academy in Searcy.\nIvor Thomas\u2019 book is one of the reference texts used in the\ncourse. He was a Labor-Socialist member of Parliament in Eng\nland. He withdrew from his party when he saw where Socialism\nwas taking his nation. He wrote his book to warn the people of\nthe world that Socialism is like a cancer of the blood stream\u2014\nit spreads and attacks and destroys the body of a nation.\nIn Harding Academy course, these goals are set up for\neach student : (1) An understanding of the world by a study of\nmen, places, events, and terms; (2) A knowledge of the main\neras and movements in history; (3) An appreciation of freedom\u2014\nhow difficult it has been to preserve freedom and how easy it\nmay be to lose it; (4) A knowledge of totalitarianism, and par\nticularly of the present form of government in Russia; an aware\nness of the kinship between Communism and Socialism, and the\nirrestable movement toward totalitarianism;\n(5) A knowledge of the principles embedded in the United\nStates Constitution\u2014division and separation of authority in\nGovernment, representative Republican form, sanctity of the\nindividual, protection for minorities, and respect for minority\nviews.\nThe Academy uses as its basic textbook for this course,\nWorld History, by Smith, Muzzey and Lloyd, Ginn and Company,\nDallas.\nIdo]lzn\u2018 go\u00e9s down, the general f{i\nnancial situation, so far as the indi\nvidual is concerned, becomes tight\ner and less bearable. Actually, of\ncourse, high taxes, while a great\nfactor in this situation, are not the\nfundamental cause. The real cause\nis the steady rise, month by month,\nin the cost of living. For this the\nchief responsibility rests with union\nlabor and business management\u2014\nno where else. This was recently\npointed out by Dr. Edwin G.\nNourse, certainly one of the most\ndistinguished economists in the\n\u2018country and a vastly different per\nson from Mr. Leon Keyserling, the\nTruman Administration and pro-\nAFL-CIO economist and the one\nso frequently quoted by the Ameri\ncans for Democratic Action and\nother far-left so-called liberals. Says\nDr. Nourse, \u201cWe should stop pass\ning the buck to the President, the\nSecretary of the Treasury, the Con\ngress and the Federal Reserve Sys\ntem. The real source of inflation\nin postwar United States has been\nin the market place\u2014the institu\ntions and practices of labor-union\n\u2018barguining and in corporation price\n; administration.\u201d\nThat this game of wage-price in\ncreases is the rock-bottom trouble\nwith the country today is not dis\nputed\u2014except by the big labor boss\nes and the big business magnates\nwho go along with them.\nNot long ago when the labor\nbosses again forced up their wages,\nPresident Eisenhower appealed to\nbig steel management not to ad\nvance prices\u2014and appealed also to\nlabor to refrain from another in-\nIN MEMORIAM '\nIn memory of our dear husband\nand father, Richard Bradford Rig\ngleman, who passed away 22 years\nago, August 19, 1935.\nGone, dear husband, gone forever:\nHow we miss your smiling face,\nBut you left us to remember\nNone on earth can take your place.\nA happy home we once enjoyed,\nHow sweet the memory still.\nBut death has left a loneliness\nThe world can never fill.\nSadly missed by his wife and\nchildren.\n- Daisie Ellen Riggleman\nTIMOTHY WITH CLOVER OR ALFALFA\nNow Paying $15.00 Cash\nOr $17.00 Trade Per Ton\nWHEAT WANTED\nNow Paying $1.65 Per Bu.

As a practical matter, he wants\nto know if he will be able to prove his con\ntention before he goes to trial.\u201d\nThis, we said, was a \u201cfishing expedi\ntion.\u201d\n\u201cThe fact that the taking of the deposi\ntion is merely a \u2018fishing expedition\u2019 to as\ncertain evidence of the other party, with\nno intention or expectation of using it in\nthe trial,\u201d Phelps states, confirming our\nclaim, \u201cdoes not in itself justify a witness,\nwhether a party to the action or not, in re\nfusing to be examined by deposition, ac\ncording to Ohio jurisprudence.\u201d\nWhich is just what he told you\u2014\u201cfish\ning expedition with no intention of go\ning to trial.\u201d\nOrganic Unity\nORGANIC\nYOU\nT011a\nunity is the fancy name creat\u00ad\ned for the long hoped for merger of\nthe CIO and the AFL.\nThe newspapers have been filled, in\nrecent days, with the announcement of\nPresident Philip Murray of the CIO that\nunification of ALL the big national unions\nshould be effected and President William\nGreen\u2019s reply, for the AFL he heads, that\nthe atmosphere favors this merger.\nBut \u201corganic unity\u201d is nothing new in\nToledo.\nCooptation between the CIO and the\nAFL has long been a reality here\u2014and an\nextremely effective reality at that.\nIt hit its stride when the United Labor\nCommittee composed of CIO, AFL, MESA\nand the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen\nand others got together to pool their\nweight politically.\nThe \u201cmerger\u201d in Toledo'for a single\nfight was a complete success.\nObservers have said for years that\n\u201corganic unity\u201d would probably begin at\nthe bottom\u2014on the local firing line.\nThis may or may not be true.\nBut when it was tried in Toledo\u2014it\nworked.\nDON\u2019T have to wait twenty-five\nyears to get the benefit of a pension\nprogram. Everyone in the community gets\nsome advantage almost immediately.\nThe older workers, of course, seem to\nbe the first beneficiaries, for they are the\nones nearest retirement age, the ones who\nwill retire on $100 a month when they are\ntoo old to work and too young to die.\nBut the youngest workers, the ones just\nentering the plants get an immediate\nboost, too. For as the older workers re\ntire, vacancies open up\u2014job opportunities.\nThe workers in the middle brackets\nget a break as the good jobs filled by top\nseniority workers become available.\nNot only the workers profit, however.\nManagement begins to feel the results as\nthe average age in the shop drops with a\nhigher percentage of younger workers,\ngnd a lower percentage of old timers.\nThe community stores get new busi\nness, both from retired workers with\nmoney in their pockets, and the, young\njpeople now on a payroll.\nThe large enterprises begin to feel the\nadded buying power as more and more\npensions are established, and finally the\ngovernment itself gets a shot in the arm\nas additional taxable income from newly\nhired young workers is created,*\nAnd, finally, the cycle completes it\nself, and the factories all over begin to\nhum as fewer persons are on a dole and\n1 more are on either payrolls or pension\nw\u00ae\nA*\ns'.-,-,*\nI' '.-\n4\nAs I See It\nBy HOWARD SEREN,\nPresident, Loeal 12, UAW-CIO\nREALITY the open shop only means the\nopen door through which the union man\ngoes out and the non-union man comes in to\ntake Ms place. The open shop furnishes, and\nalways furnished, the best possible means of\ndestroying the organization of the men. The\nclosed shops are the only\nsure protection for the trade\nagreements and the defense\nof the individual. The em\nployer naturally discharges\nthose who have been most\nactive in the union, who are\nalways asking for decent\n-uoo iunJOM Jattaq \u2018so3ex\n..ditions and shorter hours.\nHe naturally employs those\nwho are most complacent,\nthose who cannot afford to\nHoward Seren lose their jobs, those whom\nhe can bring to be dependent on his will. The\nopen shop 'means uncertainties and anxieties:\nit is a constant menace to the union man\u2019s in\nterest. He understands that his job is depen\ndent upon his lack of interest in the union\nmen who belong to the unions resent making\nsacrifices for the benefit of the non-union men\nwho work by their sides and who, are always\nfirst to claim and receive without danger and\nwithout labor the benefits of every struggle\nmade by the union.\nTo prevent trade unionism from being con\nquered in detail, to keep its members from be\ning thrown out through the open door, to main\ntain the best conditions in the shop and strive\nfor other gains better still, to save the worker\nfrom long hours of toil, to preserve the gains\nalready made, all these need the effort of every\nunion man, and without the right to protect\nthemselves in a closed shop by refusing to\nwork with those whose weaknesses make them\nunfaithful to their fellow, workers, trade union\nism cannot hold that which it has won, still\nless go forward to greater accomplishments.\nAny member of the union who thinks his\nunion is a slot machine where you stick in your\ndues and get a payoff in better working con\nditions, is all wet. Neither is the union a store\nwhere you buy shorter hours and higher wages.\nA union is a co-operative enterprise, a demo\ncratic body of workers, in which each one does\nhis share of work and takes his share of re\nsponsibility. Its measure of success is the\nmeasure of cooperation of its members.\nGOP Confusion\nOver Its Platform\nGrowing Worse\nBy Bradford V. Carter\nFor Labor Press Association\nWASHINGTON\n(LPA)\u2014With the primaries\ncoming nearer, the Republican confusion\nover their \u201csales talk\u2019\u2019 to the voters grows\nmore confounded. They have been casting\naround for a winning slogan for a long time\nnow, and thought they had come up with one\nthey unfurled the \u201cLiberty versus Socialism\u2019\u2019\nbanner in a party policy statement on the eve\nof their big shindig in Washington Feb. 6.\nThey had tried \u201cstatism,\u201d and the voters\nrefused to get scared.\nThey had tried \u201cwelfare state,\u2019\u2019 and in the\nLehman Dulles contest in New York, that\nflopped.\nThey had been bleating about the \u201chand\nout state,\u201d concentrating their fire on social\nwelfare programs. Those, they said, were\n\u201chandouts.\" They were silent on the subsidies\nto big business, which of course, are not\n\u201chandouts.\" That failed.\nSo they trotted out \u201cLiberty versus Social\nism.\u201d That was so absurd that even their own\nparty members rebelled. Papers by no means\nfriendly to the Fair Deal pointed to the idiocy\nof calling the program or President Truman\nsocialist.\nThe critics within the party not only com\nplained about making \u201csocialism\" the issue,\nbut complained of the vagueness of other\nplanks, the omissions, the pussy footing and of\nthe length of the policy statement.\nSenator Margaret Chase Smith, Maine, one\nof those dismayed by the original statement,\nsuggested that a digest of the platform be pre\npared. It was, under direction of Sen. Owen\nBrewster, Maine, chairman of the Republican\nSenatorial Committee, and Rep. Leonard W.\nHall, New York, chairman of he House Repub\nlican committee.\nThe digest, approved by the party\u2019s na\ntional committee, makes 10 points. And where\nis the \u201cLiberty versus Socialism\u2019\u2019 plank?\nIt\u2019s No. 10. It reads: \u201cSafeguarding liberty\nagainst socialism,\" No. 1 is now tax reduction,\nand No. 2 is balancing the budget.\nThe shift in emphasis did not bring peace\nto the GOP. Although the news release with\nthe digest said that Republican candidates are\nexpected to incorporate the digest into their\ncampaign pamphlets, Senator Robert Taft,\nOhio, immediately roared that the digest \u201chas\nno official standing whatsoever,\" and that\n\u201cnobody was consulted about this except the\ncampaign committees.\" Told that the digest\nhad been prepared with the cooperation of\nGOP national chairman Guy Gabrielson, Taft\nstill said the statement was unofficial and that\nno switch in emphasis could be construed.\nAnd Gabrielson, two days later, asserted\n\u201csocialism\" is still the major issue. He still\ndeclared his \u201cdeep concern\" over the \u201cschemes\nin Washington which have us drifting down\nthe road to socialism.\u201d\nThe progressives among the Republicans\nare no more pleased by the digest than by the\noriginal statement. Said Sen. Irving M. Ives,\nNew York: \u201cI still think we should specifically\nindorse fair employment practices and other\ncivil rights legislation and state just what kind\nof a labor-management relations act we favor.\u201d\nSaid Rep. Jacob K. Javits, New York: \"It cer\ntainly should have found room for the Repub\nlican position on civil rights and FEPC.\u201d And\nSen. Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., Massachusetts,\nin criticizing the original longer statement\nhad warned that the \u201cLiberty versus Social\nism\" slogan would not make many votes for\nthe Republicans.\nBut the chief trouble with the original\nstatement, and with the digest, and with all\nthe various blasts by the Republicans was\npointed out by Rep. James G. Fulton, Penn\nsylvania, in his criticism of the original state\nment. He said it ignored the fundamental divi\nsion with the party: \u201cWhether we go back to\nMethusaleh or offer alternative programs of\nsocial progress within the framework of a\nbalanced budget.\u201d\nThe GOP high command, despite dissident\nvoices within its ranks, still wants to \u201cgo back\nto Methusaleh.\u201d\nThe people of this nation do nL\nI\n,? c-V* Z 4\u2019\n4 i 4\n-., -\u2019. ,\u00bb\u25a0 ^A\n\u2022'\u25a0szv\nJ-?4\nYou know Joe.

All he\naskes is the opportunity to earn a\ndecent living. In short, the chance to\nenjoy the benefits of the American\nway.\nJoe is stubborn about certain\nthings. Gets hopping mad when any\none tries to push him around.\nRight now Joe is pretty mad.\nA couple of years ago Congress\npassed the Taft-Hartley Act. Joe\nthought it downright unfair. Joe isn\u2019t\nalone in knowing the Taft-Hartley\nAct is a thoroughly bad law.

And, in\norder to prove their point, the eminent edi\ntorialist quotes Mr. F. Raymond Peterson,\npresident of the American Bankers Asso\nciation, to the effect that America today is\n\u201cconfronted with an ever increasing trend\ntoward nationalization of credit.\u201d This, of\ncourse, in the eyes of the editorialist,\nmeans that we are rapidly marching\ntoward socialism.\n\u201cMr. Peterson is right/\u2019 thunders the\neditorial writer indignantly.\nAnd he continues to point out that\n\u201ccredit commitments of more than 20 gov\nernment lending agencies now exceed $26\nbillion.\u201d This, the gentleman points out,\nis \u201cmore than half of the total of $42 bil\nlion of loans outstanding on the books of\nthe nation\u2019s commercial banks.\u201d\nAnd then, as if to drive the last nail\ninto the coffin, the editorialist trimphantly\npoints out that this is \u201csocialized credit\u201d\nand, therefore, socialism itself.\nHow horrible! Isn\u2019t it? Or is it? Well,\nlet\u2019s see.\nEDITORIAL in question specifi\ncally mentions the RFC (Reconstruc\ntion Finance Corporation) as one of the.\nleading loan agencies of the government.\nThat seems to be fair enough. But, and\nthis makes the very mention of RFC in it\nself as lending support to this malicious\npiece of writing, what these eminent and\ndistinguished scholars fail to mention is\nthe fact that the RFC was set up originally\nby Herbert Hoover when that lamentable\ngentleman was still on the payroll of us\nU.

Paul Block knows well that it was\nMr. Hoover who set up the RFC for the\nspecific purpose of loaning jnoney to bank\nrupt business corporations. This was nec\nessary, we were told at the time, since the\nprivate commercial banks refused to lend\nmoney to these same outfits. So Mr. Hoo\nver dipped his hands into the public trough\nto save his friends from financial bank\nruptcy.\nWe haven\u2019t the space here to go into\nthe details of the other loan agencies of the\ngovernment, but like the RFC all of\nthem were created for similar purposes.\nIn other words, the bankers didn\u2019t\nwant to risk their dough for fear of losing\nit. But it was entirely okay for the gov\nernment to risk public funds, in many,\nmany instances using such public funds to\nguarantee loans made by these same\nbanks.\nARE NOT HERE arguing whether\nor not these government loans consti\ntute \u201cSocialist credit\u201d or not. But we do\nwant to point out that it was not started by\nPresident Truman, and not even by Presi\ndent Roosevelt. It was started by that\n\u201cgreat engineer\u201d who engineered our\ncountry into the greatest economic crash\nin history.\nSo, Mr. Block, why don\u2019t you nail Hoo\nver to the cross? Why don\u2019t you call him\na socialist? Or would that be too nonsensi\ncal even for you? Perhaps, but at least it\nwould be sticking to facts.\nWe\u2019re told that Paul Block is a right\neous young man. If that be the case this is\none time when he can make a public dem\nonstration of his vaunted righteousness.\nAll he has to do is admit the truth. And\nthat shouldn\u2019t be too difficult, should it?\nAs for the editorial writer who penned\nthis masterpiece of lies, we believe he is\nfar beyond the stage where human beings\n\u2014even the very calloused ones\u2014feel any\nremorse over such trifles as being caught\nand nailed down in the direct act of at-\ntempting to pass off an obvious lie.\nOU REMEMBER at the \u2018beginning .of\nthis litle piece we mentioned Hitler\nand referred to his tactics. Of course, we\nhave reference to Hitler\u2019s dictum to his\nfollowers wherein he said, in effect,\nwhen you lie, lie big and keep repeating\nthe lie until people accept your lies as\ntruths.\u201d\nPaul, you ought to be more careful.

Spicer officials declare that they will not agree to\nANY CONTRACT that the UAW-CIO Local 12 may wish to\nnegotiate with them, unless such a contract is modified so thatr\ncertain now prevailing practices shall be completely eliminated.\nThese conditions are: (1) eliminate the full-time union bargain\ning committee (2) change the so-called union security clause.,\nnow in the agreement and (3) eliminate the system of double\ntime pay for work performed on Saturday afternoons.\nEvery one of these points is fundamental and basic to any\nunion contract. Together with seniority, they are the very guts\nof our agreements.\nEvery trade unionist has fought for these points\u2014some of ,\u25a0\nthem giving their lives in these battles\u2014so that they may be\nincluded in our collective bargaining agreements.\nAnd now, with an arrogant sweep of their hands, the Mas\nter\u2019s of Spicer\u2019s wish to sweep them aside as if they were of no\nconsequence to anyone.\nHOWEVER, AS SERIOUS as these points are, that is not\nwhat we wish to discuss at the moment. Rather it is the brash\nand incredibly irresponsible attitude of this powerful indus\ntrial concern that draws our attention.\nIn our language and, we believe, in the language of the\nAmerican people, collective bargaining means just what it says.\nIt is sane and responsible bargaining between people on prob\nlems of mutual interest.\nCertainly it is not bargaining when one side declares openf^j\nly and in advance of any bargaining session that they INSIST\nthat they DEMAND the elimination of certain basic points\nBEFORE ANY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING TAKES PLACE, s\nThat isn\u2019t bargaining. That is an ULTIMATUM, an open\nDECLARATION OF WAR.\nSuch a policy is the complete negation of the process of\nCollective Bargaining.\nSuch a policy is ABSOLUTE DICTATORSHIP and the\ntotal elimination of DEMOCRACY.\nObviously, neither the UAW-CIO nor any other self-1\nrespecting organization or group of American people can accept\nsuch arrogant dictation.\nConsequently, we have no choice but to prepare for t\u25a0\nfight to protect our democratic rights and principles.\nOF COURSE we are not \u201citching for a fight.\u201d We want\npeace. We want HONEST COLLECTIVE BARGAINING.\nAnd it is up to the Masters of Spicer\u2019s to make that\npossible.\nThe UAW-CIO does not deny that there may be problems\nthat the management at Spicer\u2019s wishes to iron out. We don\u2019t\neven deny the possibility that the very basic points that we\nare here discussing may need possible clarification and even\nmodification in some fashion.\nAll that Is possible. But all that must come in the course\nof HONEST COLLECTIVE BARGAINING between our Union\nand Spicer\u2019s and not through the form of an arrogant Declare\ntion of War on the part of Spicer\u2019s management.\nIt is our firm conviction that there is not a single issue\ndispute between Spicer\u2019s and the UAW-CIO ^at cannot be\nironed out, through HONEST COLLEC'i\u2019IVE BARGAINING,\naround the conference table.\nOn the other hand let there be no misunderstanding on this\ncrucial point: the UAW-CIO will fight with every ounce of its\nstrength to protect itself and the basic rights and interests of\nits members. \u2022.\nInside\nRegion 2-B\nBy Charles Ballard\nDirector Region 2-B UAW-CIO\nRECENT investigation by Twentieth Century Fund discloses\nthe attitude of many businessmen with regard to Pension\nPlans and Welfare Funds being promoted by labor unions\nthroughout the country. Out of 82 firms contacted there were\nthirty-five who were in favor of providing for the security of\ntheir aged workers. These enlightened companies argued that\n(1) Employees need greater security (2) Pension plans are\ngood for Labor-Management relations.\nAmong the 47 business men who preferred to grant wage\nincreases rather than establish pension plans or welfare funds\nthe reasons were varied. The officials of several corporations\nwere of the opinion that employees do not appreciate welfare\nplans. This attitude, no doubt, has its origin in the paternalistic\nphilosophy shared by altogether too many employers. Remem\nber the company houses, company stores, company towns of a\nfew years back? Employers forget their obligation to pay a liv\ning wage. They do not realize that a workingman cannot save\non a subsistence wage.\nAnother reason given was that welfare plans are too in\nflexible. Wages can be renegotiated, but once a pension plan is\nin effect it becomes a permanent obligation, and as one re- e\nspondent is quoted as saying, \u201cOnce you put in a benefit plan\nyou are stuck with it for life.\u201d\nWorkers are not unaware of this fact. We have come out\non the short end o( the wage deal for too long a time. We are\nnow demanding permanent benefits, benefits which will not\nfade in the course of time.\nManagement men were of the opinion that their employees\nwere able to provide for their own security at existing wage\nlevels. Regardless of what an employer thinks, the wage earner\nknows that it is impossible for him to put away for the future.\nThe average worker, and that includes about every body who\nworks in a shop or factory, when he totals his wages each\nmonth and stocks up what he has made less deductions, finds\nthat there is insufficient funds to meet the rent or house pay\nments, furniture payments, School bills, taxes, etc. ad infinitum.^../'\nA worker with a bank account is about as scarce as a mosquito j*\non the north pole.\nThen there were those among management who said that\npension plans were exclusively a management perogative. It\ndoes not take much reflection to see the ridiculousness of such\na contention. Whether management likes it or not, there to no I\none more interested in a worker\u2019s security than the worker him\nself. Labor associations are formed by working people express- i\nly for that purpose. That is why the worker joins a labor union,\nwhy he pays dues. Through co-operative action the men in the 1.\nshops are able to promote for themselves those benefits which\nare rightfully theirs.

He will neg\nlect to add, either because he\ndoesn't know or chooses to\nignore it, that Socialism in\npract ce actually means shar\ning the poverty.\nAsk a capitalist or a believer\nin the capitalistic system and\nthe definition you will get\nfrom him is that \"equality\" is\nwhat develops in a civilization\nin which all citizens have equal\nopportunity and equality be\nfore the law.\no e n i n with the\nFrenr'h Revolution the socialis\ntic dream of equalitv of wealth\nhad led to vast cruelty and\nendless bloodshed, all to very\nlittle purpose. At times the\nboureeois e and the upper class\neither have been releeated to\nthe sidelines or completely\nliquidated by the proletariat\nwealth has been confiscated\nand divided.

Webster defines state socialism as a\n\"form of socialism using the power of the\nstate to equalize incomes bv measures such\nas progressive income and inheritance taxes\".\nIn other words using the power of the gov\nernment to \"distribute the wealth\" taking\nthe monv of those who have earned and sav\ned it and giving it to others who have done\nneither. Using our own money to acquire\nmore and more power over us and to take\nmore and more of our freedom away from us.\ntune of\nTlie American Way\npeople discovered that the\nbeautiful theory of equal shar\ning of the wealth does not\nwork out in practice. By killing\noff or rendering inactive the\nbrains of a nation, the sum\ntotal of accomplishment is\npoverty for all.\nAny government can im\nmediately establish equality of\na sort bv taking awav property\nfrom the rich 'haves\" and dis\ntributing it among the poor\n\"have-nots.\" Currently that is\nWhat we are doing through\nprogressive income taxation,\nsocial security, unemployment\ndoles, public housing, farm\nsubsidies, federal aid to educa\ntion, etc. In the past, whenever\nand wherever a government\nhas undertaken equal distribu\ntion of the wealth, the \"have\nnots\" did not become less poor.\nNotable examples of this are\nthe French and Russian Re\nvolutions.\nWhy did these fail? Simply\n\u2022because confiscation of the\nproperty of the rich, even if\nhonestly distributed among the\ngeneral population, no more\nraises the level of wealth than\na cup of water appreciably\ni*aises the level of the water in\na bathtub. The net result of\nthose two involutions was to\nproduce an equality of poverty.\nThis is always easy to do and\nPennsylvania and Illinois.\nOhio's value added by manufacture in\ncreased from 6,357,957,000 to $12,371,767,000\n\u2014a whopping percentage boost of 94.6, con\nsiderably more than other leading states.\nDuring this period, Ohio added a con\nsiderable number of plants and other prop\nerty. Ohio manufacturers' expenditures for\nnew plant and equipment rank No. 1 in the\ncountry. Ohio manufactures invested $1,$53,\n550,000 in plant and property in 1956. This\nwas more than was invested in Michigan,\nPennsylvania, Illinois, California and New\nYgrk, in that order, respectively.\nAn important faetor considered by man\nufacturers locating new plant and property\nin Ohio is the availability of abundant, low\ncost electric power, the Institute pointed out.\nIndustrialists shopping for new plant\nsites favor Ohio over all other states except\nCalifornia, according to a recent Business\nWeek magazine survey of\nAili'ttliiemmt\nFrom where 1 sit...

That is how\nstate socialism grows. When the bureaucrats\nget ahold, they hang in there and keep mul\ntiplying.\nany dictatorship can accom\nplish it. What dictators cannot\naccomplish is something far\nmore difficult an equality\nof plenty.\nHere in American we had\nmade considerable progress\ntoward an equality of plenty\nin a capitalistic economy. It\nwould be idle for us to contend\nwe had reached that much-to\nbe-desired goal, but we were\ndn the right track. At least, we\nhad traveled further toward\nit than has any other nation\nin the entire history of the\nworld.\nBut our forward march to an\nequality of plenty has been\nsadly interrupted, if not com\npletely halted, in recent years.\nWe have permitted the deve\nlopment of a centralized, pa\ne n a i s i o v e n e n a\nWashington, which has set up\na bureaucracy that is devitaliz\ning th(j initiative and self-reli\nance of our citizenry.\nWe had learned that the\nformula for achieving an equa\nlity of plenty is to produce a\nsufficiently large quantity of\nthings, and that the distribu\ntion of them will take care of\nitself. The automobile is but\none of many things which can\nbe cited as proof of this. We\nproduce the automobile in\nlarge quantities, and witness\nthe manv millions of passenger\ncars that travel our highways\ntoday.\nIf the United States is per\nmitted to resume along the\npathway on which it started\nand along which it journeyed\nfor a century and a half, it is\nnot unreasonable to assume\nthat eventually we will achieve\nan equalitv of plenty, without\nanv governmental planning or\ninterference.\nJust as there is a minimum\nof things necessary to man's\ndecent subsistence, there is a\nmaximum of things that he can\nuse. Therefore, when sufficient\nproduction, of all things nec\nessities, semi-luxuries and lux\nuries has been accomplished\nthere will be plenty of every\nthing for everybody and an\nequality of plenty will have\nbeen established.

The consequence has\nbeen a new mood of pessimism\nthat makes us \"humble.\"\nBut perhaps the timer word is\nthat we have been humiliated\nand have reacted in fear and\nanger. These are dangerous\nmoods, bringing such loss of faith\nin our free way of life as to give\nit up, hence trends to the \"left,'\nor else haughty recoil in terms\nof refusing to widen our hori\nzens, hence movements to the\n\"right.\"\nThe answer is not a comprom\nising \"middle way\" but a reeov\nery of our proud heritage of free\ndom in the humble spirit of\nrealizing that we have yet to\nrefine it. To \"go forward\" into\nsocialism is to go backward yet\nsimply to \"go back\" to things\nas they were is not to go for\nward.\nHence the \"libertarian\" em\nphasis, beyond both liberalism\nand conservatism, seeking\npreserve freedom but bent\nimproving it, proud of our heri\ntage yet humbly working to make\nit better.\nDouble-Crossing Hero\nThat perennially favorite Wes\ntern, \"Gunsmoke,\" did a remark\nable thing the other night.

FOREMAN N\nBackground Scripture: Luke 18:18 L\n;zi)lrl\"\\\"u\ufb02ollal Reading: Joshua 24:14 .\nMan Can Choose |\nLesson for February 19, 1956 !\nTHE difference between man and !\nthe other animals is not in one |\nthing but in many things. But one |\nof the most important facts about \u2018\nman is his power of choice. Some\nlittle creatures of the sea just sit |\nin one place their life long. Others :\ndrift with the tides. Higher ani- |\nmals like dogs and horses make\nsome choices; but only man makes,\nor can make, the ESEweE .\nenormous number 7S 3\nof decisions that ' \u00a78\nevery man makes, . \u00a7\nand only man can \u00a5 \u201d\ufb01';\"\nmake choices that \u2018_ i\nhave the far-rang- \"\ning results that hu- - b T 8\nman choices some- gl -'\ntimes have. A dog B\ndoes not decide\nwhat time he will Dr. Foreman\nget up; but man sets an alarm\nclock. A dog does not select his\nbreakfast; man does (or would like\nto). A human being decides what to\nwear, where to work, whom to mar\nry, whether to have children,\nwhether to be a good citizen or no\ncitizen at all. He selects a school or\ncollege, he selects his friends, he |\npicks out a lot in the cemetery, he\nmakes a will. Man is the choosing\nanimal. And he is this because he\nis morc than body. He is mind and\nsoul. l\nWhen Choices Are Important\nEverybody knows that some !\nchoices are more important than\nothers. At least everybody should\nknow this: but for some reason,\npeople will put more thought into\ntrifling decisions than they do into\nbig ones. People need to learn what\nis important and what is not. A\nwoman who had had a nervous\nbreakdown told the writer that it\nall started when she couldn\u2019t make\nup her mind which of two hats to\nbuy. One was only one dollar more |\nthan the other, and she could af- |\nford the dollar. But she actually lay |\nawake all night worrying about\nwhether she had a moral right to\nspend that extra dollar when there\nwere so many people in the world.\nSo she worried herself right into a\nsanitarium because she built up a |\nS \u2014\u2014\nil'm(l these reflections may wondel\u2018}\n\u2018how I arrived at the undm\u2018stan(ling;\nthat socialism has failed.\u201d He\nchooses to characterize socialism\nas \u201cThe Flop of a Century.\u201d In ad\ndition, the printed Yecord is filled\nwith many evidences that Great\nBritain\u2019s socialist experimenters\nhave had all they want of socialized\nindustry. |\nMr. Eastman concluded that: \u201cT\n}\\\\':l.\\: deceived about the socialist\nmovement,\u201d and \u201cIt is better to be\nI('uuragoou.\\'ly humble about this and\n\u2018admit frankly that socialism wasi\na mistake.\u201d He also warns that: |\n\u201c It is not only the Communists, |\nit is in a more subtle way the So\ncialists who are blocking the ef\u2018i\nforts of the free world to I'(\u2018COVGI\u201c\nits poise and its once-firm I\u2018e-|\nsistance to tyranny.\u201d '\nPerhaps, Mr. Thomas has a point |\nAnyone Desiring\n@ Standard Oil Co.\nPRODUCTS\nY Esso Gasoline\nwEsso Diesel Qil\nY Esso Kerosene\nY Esso Heating Oil\nEsso Motor Oils\nFor prompt, efficient and courteous service\nCall SHadyside 6-2301\nARNOLD E. FOX\nFRIENDSVILLE, MARYLAND\nI trifling decision into a Terrifie\nProblem. What makes a choice im\n| portant? Surely a choice that lasts\n* a long time is more important than\n| one that makes a difference only a\n| few hours or days. A choice that\n| affects one\u2019s whole life is more im\n: portant than one that affects only\none part of it. A choice that lasts\nbeyond this life into the next, a\nchoice for eternity, is surely the\nmost important of all.\nChoosing Christ\nBecoming a Christian can be de\nseribed in various ways: one of the\nmost meaningful is \u2018\u2018choosing\nChrist.\u201d\u2019 Jesus himself used to say\n\u2018 \u2018\u201cBelieve in me\u2019 or \u201cFollow me,\"\n{ which mean much the same thing.\nChoosing, or believing in Christ, is\n' much more than just adding cer\n| tain beliefs to whatever else you\nl happen to believe. It is more than\nadding one more person to a list of\npersons you already admire. Choos\ning Christ is a far more profound\n! thing. Real choice of Christ in\n{ volves a turning-about of the whole\npersonality. The captain of a ship\nheaded north does not merely be\nlieve that North exists; he heads\nthe ship that way, he keeps it mov\ning toward the north star. So a\nperson who chooses Christ does\nnot simply believe that he exists,\nor that he is Son of God. He\nturns the helm of his life toward\nhim, he keeps moving in the di\nrection of Christ the \u2018\u201c\u2018Morning\nStar.\u201d\u201d If that rich young man\nwhom Jesus loved had followed in\nstead of turning away, who knows\nwhat a changed man he would have\nbeen? We do know that the dishon\nest grafter Zacchaeus, a man of\nwhom his neighbors could have ex\npected little good, once he let Jesus\ninto his life, was a radically differ\nent man.\n| Time and Eternity\nChoice for Christ is a choice for\na lifetime; so is choice against him.\nIt is not a choice you make once\nand that's an end of it. It is a choice\nthat has to be made again and\nagain day by day. Every day\nbrings you some moment of de\ncision, where the way you decide\nis really a choice for Christ or\nagainst him. Deciding for Christ\naffects all your other decisions.\nFor now you are his, and all your\nlife's course is steered by his star.\nMore than this: decision for Christ\nis a choice for Eternity. You enter\nthe life beyond as his friend, or not\nhis friend. He is the Light of the\nworld. To turn from him is to\nchoose the dark. \u2018\u201c\u2018There are only\ntwo roads through life: with him,\n| or without him. There are only two\nends of life: with him, in the light,\nor without him, in the dark. The\nlight is his gift; but the choice is\nyour own.\u201d\u2019\n(Based on outlines copyrighted by the\nDivision eof Christian Education, Na\ntional Council of the Churches of Christ\nin the U. S.

SPIVACK, Washington, D. C.\nHow \"Free\" Is TV?\nWASHINGTON, D. C.\u2014The Amer\nican television industry, already\nunder fire by FCC Chairman Newton\nMinow for its low cultural level, now\nfaces a variety of new and equally\nbasic challenges.\nThey arise out of a speech by for\nmer Governor Leroy Collins of Flor\nida, the refreshingly outspoken presi\ndent of the National Association of\nBroadcasters,\nGovernor Collins feels the tele\nvision industry ought to take a look\nat the content of some of its cigarette\ncommercials. He suggests that solid\nmedical evidence indicates that smok\ning is a health hazard, but that the\ntobacco companies are continuously\nand insidiously encouraging young\npeople to take up the habit.\nGovernor Collins' contract as head\nof the broadcasters trade association\ncomes up for renegotiation in late\nDecember, so his decision to force\nthe issue at this time comes under\nthe heading of extraordinary brav\nery, far above and beyond the nor\nmal call of duty.\nWhether he has taken his head in\nhis hands remains to be seen. The\nnetworks are clearly annoyed that\nhe has chosen a public forum in which\nto discuss the industry's duties and\nresponsibilities.\nRAISES TWO PROBLEMS\nThe problems posed by Governor\nCollins divide into two categories:\nFirst, and the focus of present\ncomment, is a question of free speech.\nWill ther television industry allow one\nof its employees\u2014and Governor Col\nlins is an employee\u2014openly discuss\nsuch an economically sensitive mat\nter?\nThe cigarette companies spend\nabout $134 million annually with the\nmajor networks.\nSecond, is whether any industry\ncan be counted on \u2014 or expected \u2014\nto regulate the content of advertis\ning where such huge financial stakes\nare involved?\nThere are corollary issues.\nWill the networks encourage\nfull discussion of the health aspects\nof smoking? One network recently\ntried it and the storm of protests\nfrom the cigarette industry was so\nintense there have been no an\nnouncements of additional tele\nvision shows on this touchy sub\nject.\nHow freely this issue is discussed\non the air by competent authorities\nis of some importance. For if we\ncannot hear about the health effects\nof smoking, than even touchier is\nsues, such as aid to public schools\nwith its church-state aspects, may\nalso be ruled off limits.\nNewspapers, of course, also take\ncigarette advertising and for the\nsmaller papers this is a considerable\nNote U.

Metcalf Reports On First Session of 85th Congress\nBy CONG. LEE METCALF\nWith the passage of the Civil Rights bill and a bill to clarify the rights\nof a defendant to have access to FBI files, Congress adjourned.\nPresident Eisenhower said he was disappointed with the accomplish\nments of the 1st Session of the 85th Congress. However, the President\ndidn't specifically say what failures of Congress disappointed him. Appar\nently, President Eisenhower was unhappy at the quality of laws enacted.\nIf the Congress is to be measured by the peaks, then the enactment of\na Civil Rights bill, the first in over 80 years, is enough in itself to make the\n1st Session of the 85th ongress a memorable and historic one.\nThe bill that finally passed was restricted to the right-to-vote rather\nthan other civil rights. It preserved, in part, the southern contention that\nthere should be a right to trial by jury for criminal contempt. The President\nwas apparently disappointed in this, too, because while he signed it he\npressed the wish that it were stronger.\nIf the measure is quantity of legislation, this Session that just closed\ndoes not compare with some others.\nExcept in time of national emergency, the first Session of each Congress\ntime of laying the groundwork for accomplishments in the second Ses\nex\nis a\nsion. Committees organize, hold hearings and give preliminary consideration\nto the bills which may become law the following year.\nSchools\u2014 We all lost on July 25\nwhen the House, by a vote of 208\nto 203, killed the bill authorizing\ngeneral federal aid to the states for\nschool construction.\nThis\nsenhower said he\nits success or failure hung on his\nexpression of support on the day\nthe bill was voted on. Then there\nwas silence. A statement by Presi\ndent Eisenhower, prior to the vote,\nthat he would be disappointed if\nschool construction legislation was\nnot passed would have done a lot\nmore good than his mention of dis\nappointment after the bill was\nkilled.\nA shift of three votes would have\nsaved the bill. 97 Democrats and 111\nRepublicans, including three of the\nfour Republicans holding positions\nof party leaders in Congress, voted\nagainst the bill. 126 Democrats and\n77 Republicans voted for it.\nwas the bill President Ei\nwanted\u2014until\nConservation \u2014 Federal multipur\npose Hells Canyon died during this\nCongress. So did Bruces Eddy Dam,\nan attempt to regain some of the\nstorage sacrificed at Hells Canyon\nbut at the expense of irreplaceable\nwildlife, fishery and scenic values.\nAll 14 Republicans on the House\nInterior Committee, joined by two\nDemocrats, voted to kill the Hells\nCanyon bill passed by the Senate.\nThe measure was saved from death\nby agreement to take it up again next\nFeb. 1. But by that time, the Idaho\nPower Company will have one of its\nlow dams so near completion as to\nmake comprehensive development al\nmost out of the question.\nA few days later, conservationists\nin Washington stopped the Bruces\nEddy drive cold.\nThe debate which preceded Senate\npassage of the Hells Canyon bill\nfocused national attention on the\nrapid tax write-off program, under\nwhich commercial utilities have re\nceived interest-free loans worth more\nto them than the federal government\nhas invested in all its power facilities\nin the Northwest, in TVA, in REA\nprojects and all other power installa\ntions since the time of Teddy Roose\nvelt.\nAs a result, both houses passed a\nbill to end this interest-free loap pro\ngram on Dec. 31, 1959.\n*\nPower \u2014Another fight developed\nout of legislation aimed at putting\nthe United States back in the race\nfor peacetime use of atomic energy.\nAs it came from committee the bill\nincluded authorization for federal de\nvelopment of reactors to generate\nelectric power, including government\naid for REA co-ops to build reactors.\nOn the floor of the House, the Re\npublicans opposed federal construc\ntion, They said the lagging program\nshould remain in commercial hands,\nwith the federal government paying\nonly for research, in which we have\nso far invested more than $15 billion\nof public funds. They succeeded in\nknocking out the construction sec\ntion, which was restored in the Sen\nate.\nDuring this Congress, the Admin\nistration continued its attach on\nREA co-ops. President Eisenhow\ner's fiscal spokesman, the Budget\nDirector, proposed doubling the\n2% rate at which REAs borrow\nmoney. At the same time, the Ad\nministration\nloan with the British government\nat 2%. In other words, the same\nAdministration which loans money\ninterest-free to commercial utili\nties, to the British government at\nhas renegotiated a\n2%, wants to charge rural electric\nand rural telephone borrowers 4%.\nMeanwhile, the need for compre\nhensive development \u2014 particularly\nfor upstream storage\u2014in the Pacific\nNorthwest was emphasized once more.\nAs of Aug. 31, the Bonneville Power\nAdministration again cut off inter\nruptible power throughout its system\nbecause we are having the lowest\nstream flows in history for this time\nof year.\nFarm\u2014One immediately notices the\nabsence of major farm legislation.\nThis year's smallest crop of farm\nlaws in 30 years resulted from a dead\nlock between an Administration,\nwhich has ignored the intent of Con\ngress for almost five years, and a\nCongress, divided by the futility of\npassing laws we know will not be\nadministered sympathetically.\nThe crop included the feed wheat\nbill, continuation of the Soil Bank,\nextension of the surplus disposal pro\ngram, compulsory poultry inspection\nand the durum bonus acreage pro\ngram. And a subcommitee began\nlooking into the spread between\nprices paid by consumers and those\nreceived by producers.\nWorthy of note in the Soil Bank\nis the adoption of a \"family farm\ncut-off,'' long advocated by Montana\nDemocrats in Congress. Acreage Re\nserve payments have a ceiling of\n$3,000 per farm. A limitation of\n$5,000 was placed on Conservation\nReserve payments.\n\u00ab\nBudget \u2014After severely criticizing\nthe spending policies of his prede\ncessors in office, President Eisen\nhower in January submitted to Con\ngress a budget calling for the great\nest peacetime spending in the history\nof the country, $71.8 billion.\nWhen his own Secretary of the\nTreasury denounced the budget as\ntoo large, President Eisenhower\nagreed and invited Congress to cut\nit. Congress had hardly settled down\nto this challenging task, when Presi\ndent Eisenhower turned up on tele\nvision to warn the American people\nthat any cuts in the appropriations\nhe had requested for defense and\nforeign aid would seriously imperil\nthe national security.\nThe next major switch came in\nJuly, when he ordered his Cabinet\nmembers to hold down spending to\nthe $70 billion level of last year.\nCongress cut the Eisenhower Budg\net by almost 8%, over $5 billion.\nDespite this budget cut, the Hel\nena Valley and Bitterroot reconstruc\ntion projects received adequate funds\nfor their progress next fiscal year.\n*\n*\nHealth \u2014While there was bitter\ncontroversy in other fields, there was\nnone on the vital question of federal\nsupport of medical research.\nPresident Eisenhower recommend\ned an appropriation of $190 million\nfor a stepped-up attack on disease\nthrough research. This was $7 million\nincrease over last year's appropria\ntion. Following hearings, Congress\nincreased the amount to $211 million.\nPresident Eisenhower\nwas turned down on a few issues.\nMany others were modified, contrib\nuting to his disappointment. As he\nsigns the bills, now that Congress\nhas adjouimed, he will be critical of\nevery change from the request he\nmade and of course there will be\nsome he won't sign. But this Con\ngress did not meekly acquiesce in\nevery demand made by the President\nand that is as it should be.\nActually a huge amount of work\nHalfway\nHas been done on such important\nmatters as liberalizing social se\ncurity; trying to get farm and\nminerals programs passed over\nAdministration opposition; increas\ning veterans pensions and salaries\nof federal employees; extending\nminimum wage coverage; tax re\nlief; redeveloping depressed areas,\nincluding Indian reservations; the\nquestion of whether to free nat\nural gas producers from federal\nprice regulation; statehood for\nAlaska and Hawaii.\nSome of these bills have cleared\none house; others have been reported\nout of committee, hearings have\nbeen completed or scheduled on\nothers.\nAfter consideration and disposi\ntion of this legislation next year, I\npredict that the 85th Congress will\nmake an outstanding record that will\ncompare favorably with any peace\ntime Congress in our history. You\npay off at the finish\u2014not on who is\nahead at the halfway point.\nMontana\u2014 On Montana issues, we\ngot away fast. Except for the routine\norganizing legislation, the first bill\npassed was the one allowing Mon\ntana to use land grant funds to re\npair the State Capitol. From a stand\ning start on the first day of this\nCongress, that bill became law in\ntime to be accepted by Montana's\nLegislative Assembly.\nMontanans next year will be watch\ning attempts by our congressional\ndelegation to pay the Crow Indians\na fair price for the right-of-way for\nYellowtail Dam, get the money to\nstart construction, and get Libby Dam\nlegislation so we can start work on\nit soon.\nAction by the First Session of the\n85th Congress included;\nConservation\nWater Pollution- By a roll call\nvote, conservationists in the House\ndefeated a powerful attack on the\nyear-old water pollution control pro\ngram. The vote was 231-185 against\nthe motion to eliminate the federal\ngrants, heart of the program, to\nstimulate the building of sewage\ntreatment plants. The attack was\nspearheaded by the U. S. Chamber\nof Commerce, the National Associa\ntion of Manufacturers and trade as\nsociations representing certain pol\nluting industries.\nMilitary Land Grab- Both houses\npassed bills, which I co-sponsored, to\ncurb the armed services' insatiable\nappetite for public domain lands,\nvast chunks of which the military has\ntaken over, then released as surplus\nwhile reaching for more.\nThe bills require congressional ap\nproval of military withdrawal or res\nervation from the public domain in\nexcess of 5,000 acres, except during\nnational emergency, and makes state\nfish and game laws apply to hunting\nand fishing on military reservations.\nA conference committee will meet\nearly next year to iron out the dif\nferences between the versions passed\nby the two houses.\nRecreation Resources- The Senate\npassed a bill providing for an overall\nstudy of this nation's outdoor recre\nation resources and needs. It is pend\ning in the House Interior Committee.\nA House committee heard bills to\nearmark 65% of receipts from the\npresent $2 duck stamp fee for pur\nchase, administration, maintenance\nand development of land for the na\ntional waterfowl refuge system and\nend Administration diversion of this\nmoney to pay current bills of the\nFish and Wildlife Service.\nFarm\nDisposal \u2014Congress\nSurplus\ntended for one year, to June 30,\n1958, Public Law 480, the surplus\ndisposal program under which we\ntrade our farm commodities for for\nex\neign currency, used, in turn, to bol\nster the economy of our allies and\nbuy strategic material.\nFeed Wheat\u2014 We also passed the\nbill allowing farmers to raise up to\n30 acres, double the previous limit,\nof wheat for feed without penalty.\nACP \u2014The AGP program was made\npermanent.\nSoil Bank \u2014Continued, after the\nAcreage Reserve program had a close\ncall. The House deleted money for\nthe Acreage Reserve, temporary sup\nplement to the long-range Conserva\ntion Reserve program, from the Agri\ncultural Appropriations bill. The Sen\nate voted to restore the $500 million,\nbut for only one year. While the\nHouse went along with the Senate\naction, there are indications that the\nAcreage Reserve is done\u2014it has\nfailed to increase farm prices or cut\nfarm production and is in growing\ndisrepute with farmers.\nThe long-range program, on the\nother hand, is well accepted, and un\ndoubtedly will be continued.\nVeterans\nCompensation\u2014 Both houses voted\nto increase veterans' disability com\npensation and dependency allowances.\nThe measure increases by 10% all\nbasic rates of compensation for serv\nice-connected disability rated less\nthan total and the additional allow\nances for dependents. The rate for\ntotal disability increases 24% to\n$225 a month.\nGI Loan\u2014 President Eisenhower\nvetoed a bill to extend the direct home\nloan and loan guaranty programs for\nWorld War II veterans to July 25,\n1959, and increase the maximum of\nloans.\nWidows' Pensions\npassed a bill to increase pensions for\nwidows of veterans of the Spanish\nAmerican War, the Boxer Rebellion\nand the Philippine Insurrection. It\nwas pending in the Senate when we\nadjourned, hung up on an Adminis\ntration recommendation that action\nbe delayed on both this measure and\nthe disability compensation increase\nuntil President Eisenhower sends up\na special message on veterans' pro\ngrams. That recommendation was\nmade in February, and the special\nmessage has yet to make it over from\nthe White House.\nNational Defense\nCivil Defense\u2014 The House voted\nto authorize $18.8 million federal\naid to the states for radiological de\nThe House\nThe Readers' Forum\nSyria, Our Next Field\nOf Blunders?\nWe fought the Korean war for tung\nsten. After spending $15 billion, losing\nmaiming 250,000 gallant splendid\nyoung Americans, we have acquired 2\nleeches, Chiang and Syngman, and our\nown tungsten mines in Beaverhead\nCounty are shut down. With starving\nminers Korean tungsten is selling for\n$10 a unit (20 lbs.) and it costs with\nliving wages in Montana $20 the unit\nto produce the essential metal.\nAnd now our Oiligarchy is mixing in\nSyria's internal affairs. Syria and Israel\nare the two republics in the Middle\nEast. Syria, about the area of North\nDakota, 72,000 sq. mi. is a republic,\nmember of the United Nations. The City\nof Aleppo on the coast has 450,000, r\nDamascus far inland 400,000. Damascus,'*\nthe oldest of all present cities in the\nworld, is in a small area of irrigated\nfertile land. The cloth 'Damusk' is\nnamed from its origin. The Damascus\nsteel was famous when some of our\nforebears lived in hovels and dressed in\nsheep skins.

These threaten the safety of\nSyria because the democratic ideals\nof Syria are likely to spread.\nIn the 'Cold War started by Churchill\nat Fulton College in Missouri when\nMr. Truman got his honorary degree,\nthe United States has sided with dic\ntators such as Franco, Syngman, Chi\nang and Kings with 50 wives, as Saud.\nWe are arming these against Syria.\nSuch is the Eisenhower Plan.\nIt is quite natural for the Syrians to\nlook to, and get help from, the Soviet\nUnion! Russia, bitterly hating Fascist\nFranco and others of his kind, is\nstanding by democratic Syria. Nasser\nis reforming Egypt. We were friendly\nto King Farouk before he was chased\nout. We do not like Egypt now.\nWe got burnt badly in Korea for\ntungsten. We will be burnt worse for\noil if we bother Syria. Tungsten is not\nInflammable. Oil is so, and explosive.\nAre Soviet submarines in Aleppo har\nbor? If so, is it because we are arming\nSyria's unfriendly neighbors?\nI am not a Jew\u2014but I do admire the\nfine little republic of Israel.

Experience has\ntaught us that utility commissions\nmust be backed by some real competi\ntion. Commissions are not a substitute\nfor competition.\nWith the power famine and unem\nployment growing: with 88% of our\nrivers electricity istill wasting; un\nharnessed; with our floods costing us\n$45 million yearly in destruction,\nshould we not speed up with every\nkind of development?\nMany of the rich and powerful\nbranded public schools as socialism\nand communism and waged a bitter\nfight against them; in fact they still\ndo. The head of General Electric has\npublicly advocated turning all of our\npublic institutions\u2014roads, schools, for\nests, dams\u2014over to private owners,\nmeaning presumably a few tycoons\nlike himself.\nThe main bulwark of democracy is\nour public schools; equally necessary\nunder present conditions, if we are to\npreserve American democracy are pub\nlic storage dams, enough to guarantee\nfull development of our public rivers\nfor the benefit of all, not just a few.\nBut so false is the propaganda of the\nprivate power monopoly that one might\nconclude from it that our Paradise\nDam was planned by officers of the\nRussian army, not by our own.\nThere is state Socialism only when\nall land and factories are owned and\noperated by the government. Anything\nshort of this is a mixed economy. The\nUnited States is and always has been\na mixed economy. If you have big busi\nness owning key industries, communi\ncations and finance you are close to\nwhat was called National Socialism in\nGermany.\nThe shortest and likeliest route to\nSocialism in the United States, accord\ning to political scientists and our own\ncommon sense is not through our pub\nlic schools or our few public dams; it is\nthrough merger and monopoly, a rapid\nly accelerating process in recent years.\nIf we are intelligently against social\nism we will try to stop, not strengthen\nmonopoly, especially power monopoly,\nby maintaining sufficient competition.\nPrivate monopoly of electrical energy\nmay come to dominate business and\neven government itself.\nAs the merging and monopolizing of\nelectricity, press, radio and financial\npools proceeds, the few at the top be\ncome fewer and their power and in\nfluence grow. The step from this\nmonopoly type of socialism to state\nsocialism is a short one. Both are ab\nhorrent and horribly inferior to democ\nracy.\nI am confident that the people will\ncome to understand and check this\nprocess. The construction of Paradise\nwould be a long step on the road of\nAmerican democracy away from every\nform of dictatorship.\u2014 S. R.

The gravest |\ndunger from the conspiraters, therefore, is in the ('n;nmunisti\nvcpaeandn aimed at the minds of our people and which seeks |\ncraduatly to swing us, first, into an acceptance of socialistic |\nmcasires, and then into full Communism by evolution or revoly- |\nF LlOll, !\nCaerefore, Socialism, which is the first unretraceable step |\nf 4 nation headine downhill, is a menace so serious that its|\nthreat cannot be separated trom that of Communism itself.\nSocialism is defined as government ownership or control of\nihe means of production and distribution. In economics, (\u2018nmmu-;\nnism requires exactly the same thing. The social philosophies, or |\nLesedos, differ at least on the surface. Some self-styled Socialists |\naccept the idea of God, Communists don\u2019t. But every Communist f\nntelleetual I've come across speaks of Socialism as the basic|\ni hilosophy of Communism.\nWhat are the signs of the growth of the Socialist idea in our |\n\u2018own nation? There are many. Farl Browder, Communist leader, |\nsavs the following measures are necessary in a nation in order |\nfor full State Socialism, or Communism, to eventually take over: |\n! \u201cGovernment deficit financing; manipulation of bank re- |\n'serves requirements: insurance of bank deposits; guarantee of |\nImortgages; control of bank credits; tinkering with the currency |\nsystem; regulation of installment buying; price controls; price\n| support for farm products; agricultural credits; RFC loans to |\nLusiness corporations; social security systems for workers; |\nvarious benefits for veterans; government housing; juggling of\n\u2018the tax structure; government-organized foreign loans; stimu- |\nlNated war armament production on a large scale.\u201d \u2018\nCan a nation employ these measures and still not have full |\nSocialism? It certainly can\u2014for a time. Ours has. The grave |\ndaneer, as Browder and all Socialists gleefully affirm, is that all\nof these measures are giving the government more and more |\npower and control in the nation\u2019s economy. As it takes control,\n\u2018the people lose it\u2014in exact ratio. That's a simple mathematical |\n'fact. When the government largely controls the economy it is a |\nSocialist government. That'\u2019s also a simple fact. And still a third |\n\u2018fact is that human liberty has never survived in a Socialist State. |\nStalin would say to Americans: \u201cTake your choice\u2014Communism |\nor gradual Socialism\u2014we\u2019ll get yvou either way !\u2019 \u2018;\n'posing FRPC and also against modi\n\"fication of the cloture rules which\nwould bar the filibuster-the only ef\n| fective weapon the South has to pre\nvent this obnoxious Federal act from\nIbeing foreed upon it.

And even should he re-\nLeant on civil rights in order to be at\ntone with his running mate, he would\n\"have to do another about-face on the\nTaft-Hartley Act, the repeal of which\n(the Democratic platform strongly\nurees.

The President pointed out\nthat during the war Russia was an\nally. He inferred that it was there\nfore all right to tell the Russians\nour war secrets.\nYet on the same day that Mr\nTruman was holding his press con\nference. an article by Gen. Spaatz,\nformerly commander of our air\nforces was published in \u201cLife\u201d maga\nzine. stating that the Russians fired\non an American B-29 in August\n1945, and deliberately stole the\nequipment and contents.\nLikewise there were, as the Pres\nident well knows, certain security\nregulations during the war which\ndid not permit any one, in the Gov\nernment to give out information ex\ncept through authorized channels\nThe Chambers and Bentley testi\nmony before the House .committee\nindicates that certain informatior\nwas given out to Russian agents\nDoes the President mean to sav that\nit was all right for officials to give\nany information indiscriminately t<\nRussian agents?\nDoesn\u2019t the President know thai\nrelations between Russia and the\nUnited States were far from close\nwhere military information was con\ncerned? Thus the Russians for r\nlong time refused to permit Amer\nican military observers to witnesi\noperations on the German-Russlar\nfront.\nAlso it is a fact that when Ameri\ncan intelligence authorities un\ncovered, in advance of the Hitler at\ntack on the Soviets in June 1941\nthe fact that the Nazis planned or\na certain day to invade Russia anc\ntold it to the Russian Ambassadoi\nin Washington, he promptly went\nto the German Embassy and naively\nasked the Germans about It.\nCareless View of Security.\nAH through the war there wert\nsuspicions that some of the Russians\nwho had acted as a front in th(\nUnited States for the Germans\nduring the 1939-to-1941 period o:\nthe war, when America was theo\nretically neutral, still did business\nfor the Nazis. Certainly the Ger\nman intelligence bureaus were no\nso stupid as to employ as theii\ne gents persons who spoke with s\nGerman accent. They preferred t(\nuse persons of other nationalities\nFor the President to excuse th<\ntransmittal of information by gov\nernmental officials to outsiders wh<\nclaimed to be Russians or friend:\nof any other country, on the grounc\nthat Russia was an ally and that thi\nonly spies were Germans or Japa\nnese, is to take a careless vi<\u00ab oi\nsecurity.

No amount of\nexcusing of that sort of looseness\nwill sit well with the American\npeople even if the object is to off\nset a piece of, political gtr^t^y in\na campaign.\nThere has been lately a teadency\n1 to belittle the evidence furnished by\nself-confessed spies\u2014as ifi the wit\nnesses need not be believed because\n| they jvere spies. Many a guilty\nperson would have escaped punish\nment in America in the past if the\ntestimony of witnesses who turned\n\"state\u2019s evidence\" had not been\n1 given credence.\nMr. Truman had many other ef\nfective answers he could have made\n1 to the cry that Communists pene\ntrated the Government during and\nsince the war.

Chlang still had a\ngood chanec to defeat the Commu\nnists\nAlthough a certain amount or war\nmaterials has been made available\nto the Chinese government in re\ncent months, most observers fear\nthat it is too late to re-create and\nstrengthen the generalissimo'\u2019*\narmies. Gen. Chiang is still fighting\nwith his back to the wall, but he\nhimself is said to be highly skeptical\nabout the final result of the war\nagainst the Communists, who since\nV-J day have been fully supported\nby the Moscow government.\nWhile we bickered in Washington\nover whether the Nationalist gov\nernment was democratic in the\nJeffersonian sense of the word, and\nwhether the Chinese Communists\nwere in fact nothing but agrarian\nreformers, the Soviet government\nsent military equipment in large\nquantities and numbers of military\ninstructors to their tools in Yenan.\nTheir objective was twofold: (1)\nto deprive the United States,\u2019through\ndefeat of the National government,\nof potential bases within easy reach\nof Siberia, and (2) to establish a\nstrong link between the U. S. S. R.\nand the countries in the Indian\nOcean area which are so rich in raw\nmaterials.\nWhile we were fretting about\nBerlin and Germany the Russians\nmanaged to establish their posi\ntions solidly in the Par East.\nThe Nanking government\u2019s de\ncision to respect scrupulously the\nsecret treaty with Russia signed in\n1939 is regarded as the last des\nperate attempt of the generalissimo\nto build a bridge to Moscow, since\nhe is beginning to lose hope that\nanything good can be expected from\nthe uncertain policies of the pres\nent* American Governmrtit.\nIt would be to the best interest of\nthe country if all the hearings by\nthe congressional committees were\nsuspended until Immediately after\nthe election, when it is to be hoped\nthe administration will co-operate\nfully in exposing to view all those\nmisguided persons in the Govern\nment who were tied in any way with\nthe Russian spy rings and activities.\nIt can't continue to be a \u201cred her\nring\u2019\u2019 in December and January.\n5 (R^produttiOn Rights Reserved.)\nWuqhTleUUiA\nj PAIHTS sIStTlwT \u00bbIASS /\nIn Colors or White\nIt keeps Your Home Bright!\n\"ttafefc B#y\u201d\nyknd*4 Wt\n$6.45 \u00ab*i\nHUGH REILLY CO.\n1334 N.

Now\nafter World War\nII, when the\nBritish Labor\nParty of Second\nInternat i o n a 1\nsympathies con\ntrols Great Brit\nain, it is this\nparty which is\niloiuing up inc *\u00bb\u00ab*\u00bb*\u2022\u00bb inomp\u00ab\u00abn.\ndevelopment of western union Into\na political and economic reality.\nThis extremely interesting fact re\nquires explanation. Why, in this\nmatter so pressing for European\ncivilization, is Mr. Churchill more\nprogressive than Mr. Attlee?\nThe exaggerations of European\nnationalism since World War I have\nbeen a curse, leading to the division\nof Europe int* Balkanlzed compart\nments, restraining trade by the im\nposition of qu6tas and actual pro\nhibitions, creating divisions among\npeoples of deep cultural affinities,\nsetting up passports and visas to\nconfine persons within very small\nareas, and creating countless other\nnuisances and irrationalities. The\nDemocratic Socialists were not the\nlast, but the first to condemn these\nirrationalities. But they seem\nhoisted by their own petard.\nThe reason is that socialism, ex\npressed in the form of bureaucratic\ncollectivism, would seem to lead\nnaturally either to nationalist isola\ntionism or to a new form of dic\ntatorial Imperialism.\nImplies State Control.\nIt Is hostile to the free movement\nof goods and populations. It Implies\nhigh centralization and strict con\ntrol by the state over all the eco\nnomic processes of life, telling per\nsons what they may produce, eat,\nwear, spend, import and export;\nwhere they may move and settle,\nbuy and sell. If Europe were to\nhave a common government on the\nsocialist pattern, it would have to be\na government exercising all these\nfunctions, and therefore a highly\ncentralized and Indeed dictatorial\ngovernment.\nBut although the most thoughtful\nand enlightened Europeans are pre\npared to surrender such portions of\nnational sovereignty as to permit\nthem larger room with, more free\ndom to njove about, they are not\nprepared to surrender to a govern\nment composed of nationals of\nmany states the power to control\ntheir lives in so intimate a manner.\nIf they must endure bureaucratic\nregulation of their whole' lives,\nFrenchmen voluntarily will endure\nit only from Frenchmen, the Brit\nish from the British, etc. And they\nwill not endure it at all except as\nit is advanced in the name of the\nnational interest.\nThus socialism leads to an in\ncrease of nationalism Unless it is\nimposed by conquest.\nThR is precisely the dilemma of\nthe Soviet Union ih its quarrel with\nYugoslavia. Marshal Tito is build\ning a socialist economy, requiring\ngreat sacrifices from the popula\ntion. Theoretically, he is an inter\nnational socialist, recognizing ft-!\ndelity to the Soviet fatherland. But\npractically, he is the haad of a non-!\nRussian state, whose population is\nunwilling to accept the disciplines\nMcLemore\u2014\nSings an Old Tune,\nBut Forgets Words\nBy Henry McLemore\nSRINAGAR. Kashmir\u2014Did you\never go half out of your mind trying\nto remember all the words of an old\nsong?\nThat happened to Jean and me\nwhen we went to\nthe Shalamar\nyesterday.\nWhen we were\nflying up here\nfrom New Delhi,\nwe made bets on\nwhat the Shala\nmar was. I bet\nthat it was a\nlake. Jean bet\nthat it was a gi\ngantic bottle of\nperfume. Our\nbets were based\non the old song\nwe had* heard\nsince we were Henry N\u00abUmm.\nkids\u2014the one that goes \u201cPale hands\nI loved, beside the Shalamar, where\nare you now? Who lies beneath your\nspell?\"\nWe both were wrong. The Shala\nmar is a combination garden and\nsummer residence, built by Moghul\nJehangir in 1619. When the heat got\nunbearable on the plains of India,\nJehangir would load his court on\nelephants and head for Srinagar,\nwhere he could sleep under blankets,\nand feast his eyes on a countryside\nthat is breath-taking in its beauty.\nAir-Conditioned Thrones.\nShalamar (and I quote the guide\nbook) is 600 yards long, 260 yards\nwide and surrounded by a high wall.\nWater from a glacial stream tumbles\ndown the center, cascading over\nseven terraces, and over each ter\nrace is a throne, where the Moghul\nand his favored one ^or ones) sat to\nbe air-conditioned by the rushing\nwater. At each terrace there are\nexquisite little houses for the ladies\nof the couit, with the summer palace\non the top commanding\" a view of\nthe entire spot.\nSuch garden* you have never\nseen. Name your flower and it is\nthere. Orchards heavy with fruit\nborder the gardens; and to see that\nimposed by socialism in behalf of\nany other country or culture.\nThe Russians, too, may promote\nRussian interests via the Cominform,\nbut let it be proposed that the\nCominform direct socialism in the\nSoviet Union and hear the reac\ntions of Stalin! t\nSocialism, which presupposes a\ncontained and controlled economy,\ntherefore would seem logically to\nlead either to intensified nationalism\nor dictatorship exercised bjf the\nmost powerful socialist state.\nIt is not easily compatible with\nmore room and more liberty, which\nwould be the real advantages of a\nconfederation of Europe. Its eco\nnomic theories drive it into political\nreactionism.\nIt is the nonsocialist states which\nare willing to mitigate national\nsovereignty; not the socialists, who\nwish greatly to extend the power of\nthe state over society. These find\nthat the state, to absorb society,\neither must 'intensify nationalism or\nbrutally suppress all nationalisms\nbut one.\nby th\u00ab BMt Sydlc*t\u00ab, Ine.)\nTHE EVENING STAR, Washington, D.

Before the world, England\nhas tried out Socialism for six vears and now has stamped it a\nfailure by eleeting a Conservative Party government. But England\nhasn\u2019t voted out Socialism. The irony is that England cannot rid\nherself of Socialism by the ballot. In six short years the decay\nhas spread too far.\nYou can't press a button or mark a ballot and transform a\nbankrupt Socialist nation into something better. Evidently the\nreason the English didn\u2019t vote the Conservatives in by a larger\nmargin was that not even Churchill, who had opposed every step\nof the Socialist program, could promise to reverse it. Realizing\nthis, England nevertheless still registered a condemnation of\nSocialism as a mode of government and way of life.\nThe Conservative Party falls heir to a nation stagnated and\ncritically weak. Never in Britain's history have the people had to\nsubmit to rationing for six peacetime years as they have had to\ndo under Socialism. At the end of the six years they find them\nselves everlastingly hungry : there isn\u2019t enough to eat, nor enough\nmoney to buy what foodstuff there is available. The government\nplanners have bungled everywhere.\nChurchili is pledged to return to private ownership only the\nsteel industry which was actually just in the process of being\nSocialized. fe says government ownership will have to continue\nin railwavs, coal, utilities, banks, the professions, and in fact\nthroughout the whole commerce. And the costly \u201cWelfare State\u201d\nhandout programs are to continue. Socialism has taxed out of\nexistence the once considerable private wealth of Great Britain.\nThere isn't sufficient private capital to buy and put into operation\nthese huge and expensive enterprises.\nThe remedy in England scems obvious. If England\u2019s 50-\nmillion people would pitch in and go to work, forgetting short\nwork-weeks, full-employment, fair shares, free medicine, their\ndoles and their phony \u201csecurity,\u201d the nation could in time become\nstrong again, master of its own destiny. But the Conservative\nParty dares not suggest this now. As the Oklahoma farmer would\nsav, the English people have a tough row to hoe.\n& \u00b0\nGets Six Years\nJudge James E. Boylan, Jr., of\nWestnminster, on Monday sent a for\nmer convict back to prison for six\nvears after the defendant had pleaded\ncuilty to charges of robbery with a\ndeadly weapon. The weapon was a\nblock of firewood, and the victim was\nMrs. Arthur E. Walsh, of near\nHampstead.\nThe one involved was Richard\nWright, 20, a former Garrett county\nman, who had recently been released\nfrom the State Reformatory for\nMales.\nWright, once an enmploye on the\nWalsh farm, had orviginally been sent,\nto prison for robbing the family of\nabout S3OO from a strong box. On\nNovember 13, Wright returned to the\nWalsh home, returned to tne strong\nbox, after striking the woman, and\ntook approximately S2O. Wright es\ncaped to a wheat field and later cap\ntured by a state troopei.\nWright wiil serve the new sentence\nin the Maryland penitentiary. It was\nrecalled here by State Senator Neil\nC. Fraley that he prosecuted a case\nagainst Wright in this county while\nhe was state's attorney.\ne s e\nBritain announced it had developed\nworld\u2019s st system of house heating\nusing atomic energy instead of scarce\ncoal.\nCONCRETE / 25 wallh.\nBN (b\n.

You will be amazed as you have been during the\npast three years.\nA blanket invitation is being extended by the merchants,\nwho are holding July clearance sales, and in many instances\nmaking a reduction of anything and every thing in their\nstore.\nYou can\u2019t beat it. The merchants have seen to that. Once\neach year, they throw the cost sheet out the window for your\nbenefit. Why not take advantage of this opportunity, which\ncomes only once a year.\nWe guarantee that you will not be disappointed. We\nurge you to read carefully the advertisements which appear\nelsewhere in this issue. It will be to your advantage.\n\u201cOpportunity Days\u201d mean just that. Come to Caldwell\nFriday and Saturday and find out for yourself. We repeat.\nYou will be amazed.\nRepatriation\nTo a man, wherever he might wander over the earth,\nthere is always one refuge, one point of returning. It is his\nhome.\nA man can no more cut away the ties of his homeland\nand of his village and the fields that he remembered than he\ncan cut away his memory or the limbs of his body.\nA man will never know another house as he knows the\nhouse of his childhood and youth. Where a man is born,\nthere is his home and there will the roots remain until he\ndies.\nWhat thing could make a man forswear his home\u2014when\na home is all that a man can feel?\nThat thing is Communism. Of 170,000 prisoners of war\nin Korea, 100,000 have declared that- they will not return to\ntheir homes. They have dedared that they will forcibly\nresist repatriation.\nThis is perhaps the most damning indictment against\nCommunism the world has yet seen. Rarely in history have\ngreat groups of soldiers or prisoners refused to return to\ntheir homeland as a result of truce or armistice.\nOne cannot fully grasp the practices of terror, fear,\nreprisal, imposed upon the North Korean and Chinese\npeople by their Communist masters\u2014but they must be\nhorrible beyond belief to make 100,000 men turn their backs\nupon their home.\nThe \u201cIsms\u201d\nIt seems to be a nasty habit these days, especially for\npolitical speakers, to hurl the name \u201cFascist,\u201d Communist,\u201d\nor some other \u201c1st\u201d at any one who dares to differ even\nslightly in his views on any of the many problems that con\nfront America today. Just what do these terms mean that\nare so carelessly tossed around? What difference is there\nbetween Nazism or Fascism, if any, or between Communism\nand Nazism, or between the lot of them and Socialism? It\nis a rather difficult assignment to attempt to define these\nsystems in a few paragraphs, but here goes for a try at it:\nCOMMUNISM is an organization of society on the basis\nof common ownership of the means of production and of the\ngoods produced. Like Socialism and Anarchism it demands\nthat production be for common use and not for private gain.\nIt regiments all labor. It differs from Socialism in its theory\nof the state, in that it sets up a federation of communes or\ngroups instead of a central administration. Communism had\nits most thorough try-out in Russia and that nation already\nhas discarded most of it as impractical and unworkable.\nFASCISM is a form of totalitarian dictatorship creating\na highly nationalistic state. It opposes political Communism\nbecause it recognizes private property and certain individual\nrights. However, its principal tenet is that society does not\nexist for the individual but that the individual exists for\nsociety. While it leaves production and distribution of wealth\nALWAYS\nFRESH\nALWAYS\nGOOD\nTHE AMERICAN W A Y\nI WAVE\nNOTHING TO\nHIDE/\nCOWMJ\u2019\nlargely to individual enterprise, it practices a strict discipline\nover business and labor organizations, banning strikes and\nlock-outs. Fascism had a thorough try-out in Italy and was\na pitiable failure.\nNAZISM is a political hash, the original ingredients of\nwhich were Socialism, Communism, and Capitalism. In\npractice, it evolved into a copy of Fascism, slightly altered\nto suit Germany, or rather the Nazi ruling clique. It stands\nfor an authoritarian corporate state banning all political\norganizations opposed to the Nazi theory. It regiments the\nindividual to complete subservience to the\" state. Nazism\nnurtures within its bosom the seeds of its own destruction\nand of any nation upon which it fastens its tentacles, as was\nso graphically demonstrated in Germany.\nSOCIALISM is a philosophy rather than a political\nsystem, idealistic in concept and theory but impossible in\npractice. It opposes the holding of the sources of wealth, land,\ncapital, etc., as private property. It does recognize that\nprivate property can be abolished only by an evolutionary\nchange in the thinking of human beings. It aims therefore,\nat \u201creforming\u201d society and \u201cequalizing\u201d people, substituting\ncollective for individual action. It seeks to set up communal\nownership for private ownership of wealth and the means\nof production. Its shibboleth is \u201cproduction for use and not\nfor profit.\u201d\nSocialism has been tried many times in many places.\nWherever it has been practiced it has become bureaucratic,\nhas seized the main activities of a nation or municipality,\nadministered them by government-appointed individuals or\nboards, and has levelled society to that intelligent, industrious\nand thrifty people had less, while the lazy, the idle, the\ninefficient and the unintelligent got more\u2014for a time. But\nthis has always ended up in all having nothing.\nAMERICANISM This \u201cIsm\u201d has many other names,\namong which are \u201cAmerican Capitalism,\u201d \u201cFree Enterprise\u201d\nand \u201cProfit and Loss System.\u201d Under this system, the\nindividual is supreme the state exists for him and not he\nfor the state. The intelligent, industrious and thrifty have\nmore than the unintelligent, lazy and thriftless. There is\nequal opportunity for all but the rewards are unequal,\ndepending entirely on the individual\u2019s contribution to\nsociety.\nIn other words, under the American Capitalistic System\nof Free Enterprise, the individual is able to indulge, his\n'natural desire to make his own way and to climb as high\nas his ability and application will carry him and having\npermitted this natural human instinct to prevail has been\nresponsible for America having attained the highest standard\nof living in world history.\nThe aforegoing are brief and rather incomplete descrip\ntions of the various \u201cIsm\u201d but they do convey the general\nidea. Which do we want in this country? It seems incredible\nthat there can be any but one answer to that question and\nthat answer is that we will string along with \u201cAmericanism,\u201d\nthe system that has served us so well for so long a time.\nGeorge Peck.\nProbably the first newspaper\nin Knox County was The Ohio\nRegister, founded June 26, 1813\nat Clinton and later moved to\nMount Vernon.\n\u201cTHE GREAT\nADVENTURE\u201d\nWITH\nDENNIS PRICE\nJACK HAWKINS\nO\n9 O\nVo\u2019\n?0\u00bb\nTHE JOURNAL, CALDWELL, OHIO\nThe Cleveland Register, which\nceased publication in March 1820,\nhad originally been founded in\nJuly, 1818, as The Cleveland Ga\nzette and Commercial Register.\nW^d.-Thurs., July 16-17\n\u201cSTREET CAR\nNAMED DESIRE\u201d\nFRIDAY AND SATURDAY, JULY 18-19\n\u201cHOSTILE\nCOUNTRY\u201d\nWITH\nJAMES ELLISON\nRUSSELL HAYDEN\nSUNDAY THRU TUESDAY, JULY 20-22\nA MUSICAL\nTHAT BUBBLES OVER\nWITH DANCING...\nROMANCING...AND\nFUN!\nrNEWY0RKf\n.W-'FlED ASTAIRE\nVERA-ELLEN Marjorie MAIN\nWEDNESDAY AND THURSpAY, JULY 23-24\n8WI\n\u201cWHEN I GROW UP\u201d\nWITH\nROBERT PRESTON MARTHA SCOTT\nThis Week\nin\nWashington\nAs the two political parties\nprepare for the long battle to the\nNovember election, it appears\nthat the American people have\nsome fine hairs to split to deter\nmine the winner of the presiden\ntial contest.\nFor, as is customary at the\nclose of the fiscal year, every\neconomist, government and pri\nvate, and all large business trade\ngroups including the United\nStates Chamber of Commerce,\ncome out with tfieir predictions\nfor business during the coming\nyear and all, without excep\ntion predict business will be\ngood and employment high.\nIn its prognostications the U. S.\nChamber reported a $40 billion\nincrease in the gross national\nproduct during the past year and\na rise of $13 billion in the nation\nal income in the first quarter of\nthe year. Prices have remained\nstable, personal savings contin\nued to -elimb, tremendous expan\nsions are planned by the oil,\nchemicals and electric power in\ndustries, the defense program is\n\u201cnow really beginning to roll\u201d\nand will proceed without undue\nhardship to the civilian economy.\nThe disturbing factor, the\nChamber said, was the ponderous\ngovernmnet payrolls. Total civil\nian employment rose in May to\n61.2 million and the roll of un\nemployed remained at a post-war\nlow of 1.6 million. In any ordin\nary year such a rosy report as\nthis particularly from the most\nconstant critic of the administra\ntion in power, would be enough\nto win an election.\nHowever, it appears this one\nis not going to be any ordinary\nelection. One issue, of course,\nwill be on foreign policy and the\nKorean war.\nThe 82nd congress adjourned\nfor the conventions with more\nwork left undone than was ac\ncomplished. As is usually the\ncase, for six months the congress\nfritters away long hours on use\nless debate and then come down\nto the last weekend passes a\nwhole raft of measures of which\n75 per cent of the membership\ndoes not know the content.

Anyone who attempts to\nminimize this vote or pass it off\nwith a wave of his hand as not\nbeing worthy of consideration is\njust plain silly. On the other\nhand, those politicians who are\ncounting on this vote being de\nlivered to them en masse simply\nbecause they are running on the\nDemocratic ticket are apt to have\na rude awakening come Novem\nber 5\u2014the morning after.\nHere\u2019s a sample of the \u201cpayroll\nvote\u201d in action. The three decisive\nstates in the \u201948 election were\nCalifornia, Illinois and Ohio. In\n\u201948 there were 203,100 federal\nenap'oyees in California, 99,300 in\nIllinois and 79,800 in Ohio. Tru\nman carried these states by a\nmajority of 35,512 in California,\n31,196 in Illinois and 8,451 in\nOhio.\nIn April, 1952, there were 257,\n900 federal employees in Cali\nfornia. 112,300 in Illinois and\n103,660 in-Ohio. In the \u201948 elec\ntion 40% of the qualified voters\ndid not vote. This election was\nwon, or lost whichever you pre\nfer by default. This must not hap\npen in \u201952.\nIt is a political maxim that each\nfederal job is good for four votes\nfor the party in power, also that\neveryone who receives benefits\nof any sort from the federal gov\nernment plus their families will\nvote for the party which provides\nthose benefits. If this were true,\nthere wouldn\u2019t be any use hold\ning a national election since with\n18 million people regularly re\nceiving checks from the federal\ngovernment and 6 million more\nreceiving checks regularly from\nstate funds to which the federal\ntreasury contributes, the outcome\nof the election would never be\nin doubt from\npaign started\nwere counted.\nthe time the cam\nuntil the votes\nfor those of us\nFortunately\nwho pay in the money to cash all\nthese federal checks, it has never\nbeen possible for the new deal\npoliticians, even though they\ntried mighty hard and have used\nevery trick they can think of, to\ndeliver this vote in toto to the\ncandidates of their party.

S. Conservatives Take Heart\nChurchill's Return, However, Is Also Grist to Stalin's Mill\nBecause if Tories Fail, Radicals Will Head Laborites\nAny election which changes\nthe man at the helm of the\nBritish Government is bound to\naffect relations with the United\n8tates.\nWhile some politicians on the\nRepublican side here profess to\nsee a trend away from socialism,\nand the Democrats believe that\nthe program of reforms adopted\nby the Labor Government will\nnot be essentially changed, the\nfact is that American conserva\ntives\u2014w'hether they be Demo\ncrats or Republicans\u2014will take\nheart from what has happened\nin England.\nCuriously enough, Stalin will\nderive considerable encourage\nment, too. For the \u201cleft wing\u201d\nin the Labor Government, which\nwants America to reduce her\narmament and appease the\nCommunists in China and\nKorea, has come back with a\nstrong vote at the polls.\nAs Stalin looks around the\nworld, his cause thrives on fric\ntion inside the democracies.\nThe rise of \u201cleft wingism\u201d is\ngrist to his mill. The \u201cleft wing\u201d\nstrength in Britain is such that,\nif the Conservative government\nfails, the next prime minister\nwill not be the moderate Attlee\nbut the extreme radical and\nSocialist\u2014Aneurin Bevan.\nWinston Churchill will doubt\nless plead here for support on\nan economic and financial basis,\nusing the argument that unless\nhis Government is helped to\ngrow stronger with the people,\nBritain will go further and fur\nther toward the \u201cleft.\u201d\nThe British Government is,\nindeed, in need of help because\nher economic situation is not as\nrosy as it has been painted.\nThe disasters in Iran and Egypt\nwill not diminish the external\nexpenses of Great Britain but\nwill increase them materially.\nAll in all, the British elector\nate is torn into three parts\u2014the\nConservatives under Churchill,\nthe moderates or middle-of-the\nroaders among the Laborites\nunder Attlee, and the radicals\nunder Bevan. The contest for\nsupremacy has by no means\nbeen settled by the electiton. It\nmay be. as happened in the\nearly \u201930\u2019s when Ramsay Mac\nDonald. as prime minister, left\nthe Labor Party to join in a\ncoalition government, and again\nduring the war when Attlee\ncame into the Churchill cabinet,\nthe majority of the British\npeople will insist on a coalition\ngovernment to see Britain\nthrough the present world crisis.\nPlainly the Conservative\nstrength plus a substantial sec\ntion of the Labor Party would\ngive, a coalition government an\noverwhelming majority. It is on\nforeign or external issues that\nsuch a coalition would be forced\nbecause on domestic issues some\nof the major differences are all\nbut irreconcilable. It could be,\nhowever, that ChurcWll. who is\na master of compromises, will\nwoo to his side more and more\nof the moderate Laborites even\non domestic questions. But if he\ndoesn\u2019t choose to follow that\nstrategy, he will be compelled\nto crystallize the Issues for an\nother test of power a year hence\nin the hope that Conservative\nstrength with the people will\nhave been enhanced by a year\nof Churchill\u2019s rule.\nIt now is expected that Great\nBritain and America will work\nmore closely than ever before.\nFormer Prime Minister Attlee\nin his decisions has been con\nstantly under the necessity of\nkeeping an expedient eye on his\n\u201cleft wing,\u201d and hence he has\nbeen growing weaker and weak\ner in dealing with America. The\n\u201cleft wing\u201d has been anti\nAmerican. Churchill, with a solid\nConservative majority behind\nhim, will have no such handi\ncap and will not appease the\n\u201cleft wing.\u201d confining his com\npromises toward the moderate\nLaborites.\nConcretely, a settlement of\nboth the Iranian and the Egyp\ntian problems will be sought by\nChurchill. The skill of the Con\nservatives as negotiators will be\ntested to the utmost. But a\nsteady hand in the British For\neign Office, guided by the re\nsourceful Churchill, may be\nlooked for to cement relations\nbetween the United States and\nBritain in whatever joint policies\nmay be evolved for the Middle\nEast. Britain, in a broad sense,\ngains on external policy by\nswitching to Churchill now.\nWhat the future may be in\nthe way of a strengthened or\nweakened British economy is not\nso readily appraised, and the\ndanger of economic deteriora\ntion\u2014as hoped for by Stalin\u2014\nhas not been removed by the\nentry of Churchill, because he\ntakes over an already badly dis\nintegrated economic sytsem.\n(Reproduction Riihtt Reserved.)\nDoris Fleeson:\nBosses Plug Saraple Chairmen\nMan of Stature Is Needed to Indicate a Housecleaning\nIs Underway, But Truman Is Slow in Deciding Issue\nPresident Truman has proved\nunable to settle quickly and\ndecisively upon a new national\nchairman whose stature will\nproclaim that a Washington\nhousecleaning is underway.\nThe result is that the party\nbosses are moving in with more\nor less respectable samples of\ntheir following in the hope that\nthe dust can be swept under\nthe rug and a real houseclean\ning averted.\nThe unknown quantity in the\nsituation remains the Presi\ndent\u2019s own frame of mind.\nThere is very little Indication\nthat he perceives more than\n\u201cjust politics\u2019* in the Internal\nRevenue, RPC and other scan\ndals, or realizes that the coun\ntry is thoroughly angry and\nunhappy about the situation.\nThe evidence Indeed points\nto the contrary. Democrats this\nweek end suggested that Prank\nMcKinney, an Indianapolis\nbanker and political associate\nof Indiana\u2019s National Commit\nteeman, Prank McHale, is in\nfront for the chairmanship.\nFrank McHale is one of the\npolitical aristocracy lucky\nenough to be on hand when\nFranklin Roosevelt moved into\nthe White House. With that\nvote-getter in front and the\n2 per cent his obliging Gov\nernor, Paul McNutt, levied on\nDemocrats holding jobs In the\nState administration, Mr. Mc\nHale kept his machine reason\nably well oiled for a time.\nThe bald and bitter truth Is,\nhowever, that while Mr. McHale\nis still doing well personally,\nhis machine has little to con\nceal these days but creaking\ngears and rusty fenders. All\nMr. Truman\u2019s efforts did not\nget him in Indiana in 1948\nthough he swept into Wash\nington several lively young\nDemocratic Congressmen. In\n1950, Mr. McHale failed to re\nelect most of these and a Sena\ntor although the Republican\nSenator then up, Homer Cape\nhart, is not one of his party\u2019s\nmost lustrous ornaments.\nIndiana does have a Demo\ncratic Governor, Henry Schrlck\ner. but like Governor Lausche\nof Ohio, he keeps his distance\nfrom party organization and\nwidely advertises his Indepen\ndence.\nMr. McKinney Is understood\nto have support within the\nWhite House circle In the per\nson of Matthew Connelly, the\nPresident\u2019s appointment secre\ntary. Many Democrats believe\nthat Mr. Connelly\u2019s Influence Is\nbecoming almost decisive since\nMr. Boyle\u2019s illness.\nBecause Mr. McKinney Is not\nwell known nationally and Mr.\nMcHale Is, Inevitably Mr. Me\nHale will loom large In discus\nsions of a McKinney appoint\nment.\nMr. McKinney is said to be\nlikable, to possess ability and a\ngood record. How much or how\nlittle business he has done in\nWashington is not known but\nhe has tried to do some. In at\nleast one instance he wanted the\nGovernment to put up the\nmoney for an enterprise in\nwhich he was interested and was\ntold by the tough-minded head\nof the agency involved to go\nhome and get it from his own\nbank.\nDemocrats who oppose the\nappointment of any Chairman\nwith machine or business ties\nto Washington in the present\nstate of public opinion have not\nalighted upon an obvious sub\nstitute. They appear to be rally\ning around former Representa\ntive John Carroll of Colorado,\nwho was defeated for the Sen\nate last year by Senator Mllli\nkin. Mr. Carroll also has ability\nand a good record, but he is not\nwell known nationally.\nSome party circles have turned\nwistful eyes on the Senate and\nits Young Turk reformers but\nthey would not be acceptable to\nthe President. A possible com\npromise is a Southern liberal.\nSenator Sparkman, who has\nmanaged the difficult feat of\nkeeping both his White House\nand Alabama fences mended.\nThomas L. Stokes:\nElation Over Tories Is Natural\nRepublicans and Southern Democrats Hope It's a Sign\nOf Delightful Things to Come at Home in 1952\nIt is only natural that Re\npublicans \u2014 and/or Southern\nconservative Democrats\u2014should\nbe somewhat elated by the Con\nservative Party victory in Great\nBritain, narrow as it turned out\nto be.\nMaybe it\u2019s a sign for 1952\u2014\nor so they hope.\nRepublicans, even those not\nglobal-minded, have gotten into\nthe habit of looking afar, be\nyond our shores, for happy\nauguries. Maine has lost its\none-time potency as a lode-star,\nand now is only coupled, for\nlornly. with Vermont.\n\u201cTory\u201d has such a soothing\nsound, especially when symbol\nized in the comforting, sleek\nand cherubic figure of Winston\nChurchill, notwithstanding that\nthe British Conservative Party\nis far. far to the left even of\nsuch Republican left-wingers\nas Senator Wayne Morse of\nOregon, and to the left, too, of\ncourse, of the Truman Fair\nDeal. But nevertheless com\nforting, withal.\nIt is, at least comparatively\nspeaking, a awing to the right.\nMaybe there\u2019s a trend. For\nthis is the third upset of the\nLabor Party in what we now\ncall the British Commonwealth\nof Nations\u2014first New Zealand,\nthen Australia, and now Great\nBritain, herself. And we are\na lot like our British cousins\nin many ways, if entirely dis\nsimilar in others. Republicans\naccepted New Zealand and Aus\ntralia as good omens before the\n1950 congressional elections.\nThey didn\u2019t turn out exactly\nthat way. While Republicans\nmade gains, they did not re\ncapture Congress.\nBut maybe there\u2019s something\nmagical in a trio.\nAnyhow, it was a bit of a\ncheck on Socialism, and will\ngive a sort of case history for\npropaganda purposes to those\nRepublicans, headed by Senator\nTaft, who are planning to make\nwhat they call \"the socialistic\ntendencies\u201d of the Truman Fair\nDeal a leading campaign issue\nin 1952.\nExcept there\u2019s a difference\nthat is often overlooked here,\nchiefly by Republicans. The La\nbor Party in Great Britain was\nelected on a socialistic \u2018program\nwhich it then put into effect.\nThe Conservatives, while ac\ncepting a considerable part of\nthe program, objected to some\nof the extreme measures, such\nas nationalization of the steel\nindustry, and complained about\nthe way some of the rest of it\nworked out. In short. Conser\nvatives in England had some\nthing concrete, a fait accompli,\nto shoot it.\nNot so here. Senator Taft\nand like-minded Republicans, in\nalliance with Southern con\nservative Democrats, have com\npletely blocked the \u201csocialistic\u201d\nprogram of Harry Truman\nwhich, according to British\nstandards, is really very pale\nSocialism, if at all. So Repub\nlicans are not dealing with\nrealities, as were British Con\nservatives, something actual to\nwhich they can point with alarm\n\u2014but only with a lifeless shad\now embodied in a passel of bills\nresting safely in pigeonholes at\nthe Capitol, and with little\nthreat of having their slumber\ndisturbed.\nFurthermore, a lot of people\nseem to like what is called the\nFair Deal, yet Unrealized large\nly. That gives Democrats the\nopportunity, which they don\u2019t\noverlook ever, of holding up\nbright promises and dreams\u2014\nand those pay ofl better in poli\ntics than imagined fears.\nEver since President Truman\ncame into office Congress has\nbeen under the control of a\nconservative party, , which is\nwhat the combination of Re\npublicans and Southern Demo\ncrats is. This coalition has been\nthe major party, through cir\ncumstances not by will of the\npeople. Harry Truman has\nbeen, according to the British\nstandard, a Prime Minister\nwithout portfolio so far as the\nFair Deal is concerned, sitting\npowerlessly in the White House\nclinging to a mandate that is\na scrap of paper. For his party\nhas won the last two elections,\nsupposed to be \u201cmandates,\u201d but\nhe has not won control of the\nGovernment. We can under\nstand that. The British couldn\u2019t.\nRepublicans might do better\nto take the direct approach and\nclaim credit frankly for stop\nping \u201csocialism\u201d here, except, of\n\u00ab\ncourse, that would be a con\nfession of mere obstructionism\nwhich would not sit well with\nmillions of voters who don\u2019t\nregard the Fair Deal as \u201cso\ncialism\u201d and are not disturbed\nby tags and slogans. Further\nmore, Republicans would have\nto confess that they had to call\non Democrats to do the job,\nand that is not good, either.\nRepublicans might gain by\nadopting a positive program\nof their own, a satchel of\ndreams\u2014mild ones, of course\u2014\ninstead of playing on fears\nabout something that hasn\u2019t\nhappened. For there\u2019s just a\npossibility that Bob Taft is\nstanding against the thunder\ning tide of history and won\u2019t\nbe able to sweep it back with\na witch\u2019s broom decorated with\nhobgoblins.\nLOUIE \u2014By Harry Hanan\nFletcher Knebel:\nPotomac Fever\nChurchill names Anthony Eden as foreign secretary.

While very rarely some\nintellectual Laborite may switch\nto the other side the rank and\nfile never does.\nThe mentality of the British\nworking classes is totally differ\nent from ours. A man fre\nquently follows the trade or\noccupation of his father or\ngrandfather and does not con\nceive that there can be any\nother chance for him. Some\ntimes he becomes an important\nmember of his trade union and\nis catapulted into politics. But\noutside that he does not have\nany ambitions of changing his\noccupation.\nA soda jerker in this coun\ntry (if such an occupation ex\nisted in Britain it would be\ncalled dispenser of non-alco\nholic beverages) may occupy\nthat position while he is study\ning law at night or taking a\nbusiness course because he does\nnot have the means to go to\ncollege full time. Such things\nare unheard of in Britain. Nei\nther would a British carpenter\nor house painter employed by\na contractor give up his week\nend leisure to make some extra\nmoney by working on his own.\nThe rise from working classes to\nwealth or responsible positions\nin industries is an exception in\nthe British Isles instead of an\neveryday occurrence as in this\ncountry.\nUnder these conditions, the\nBritish working classes and\nsome of the white-collar work\ners look on their newly created\nparty, which came into exist\nence as a political power only\n30 years ago, as their only hope\nof betterment.\nThe Attlee administration |\nbrought these hopes to a cli\nmax when it decided to make\nSocialism in our time an im\nmediate reality. The over\nwhelming masses of working\npeople saw for the first time\na chance of getting somewhere\nfor nothing. Their Govern\nment, which contained a fair\nproportion of \u201cgentlemen,\u201d of\nfered them a paternalism with\nout any strings.\nThe nationalization of the\ncoal industry was achieved with\nout any cost to the laboring\nclasses. A loan from America\namounting to nearly $4 billion\nhelped put through this great\nsocial reform. It also helped\nto provide the United Kingdom\nwith a health program which,\nwhile not entirely free, made\na great difference to individ\nuals who in the past could not\nsee a physician, dentist or oc\nculist because the fees were out\nof proportion to their earnings.\nPolitics In Britain has become\na class matter.\nThe incentive to make \u201creal\ndough,\" a characteristic of the\nAmerican worker, does not\nexist in anywhere near the\nsame proportion in Britain.\nThe only additional income the\nEnglish worker expects to get is\nby placing a bet of a \u201ccouple of\nbob\u201d with bookies at the race\ntracks.\nWhen \u201chis party\u201d came to\npower after the second World\nWar the promises that homes\nfor workers would be built by\nthe Government were first re\nceived with incredulity. Later\nit became one of the most im\nportant vote-catching assets\u2014\nalmost as important as the de\nstruction of the wealthy class.\nIn this country the working\nmen would try to build their\nown homes with their own sav\nings and loans from wherever\nobtainable and also by doing\nmuch of the labor themselves.\nThis spirit is practically non\nexistent in Britain.\nIn these last 30 years the\ntheoreticians of the Labor Party\nhave almost convinced its rank\nand file that Socialism is the\nonly cure for the present world\nills and capitalism is its actual\ncause. This idea, which some\nof our extreme \u201cliberals\u201d have\nattempted to instill in the minds\nof their own followers, has not\ntaken deep roots.\nThe British Labor Party is as\nfirmly disciplined as was the\nGerman army in the days of\nthe Kaiser. No such discipline\nexists in the United States fn\nany political or labor group.\nThe members of the British La\nbor Party, skilled, unskliled and\nwhite-collar workers, have ac\ncepted during the last six years\nthe most stringent rationing\nand a fare approaching starva\ntion. They grumbled occa\nsionally, but did not flinch be\ncause of the hardships in their\nallegiance to the party and the\nleaders who had promised them\nan eventual millenium. Ameri\ncan voters even in the Deep\nSouth are far more volatile po\nlitically. And because of these\ngreat fundamental differences,\nthose who wish to draw a paral\nlel between the electorates of\nthe two English-speaking coun\ntries may find themselves in\nerror.\n| HOUSEHOLD GOODS\nLimited space in apartments fre\nquently requires storage of furniture,\ndraperies, rugs, linens, etc.\nOur service provides protection for\nyour household goods from the mo\nment they leave your home until\nthey are returned.\nCall far Estimata\nfidelity Storage.\nr.\n1420 You St. N.W.

Several Times . .\nSome time back a bunch of wild-eyed gents sat them\nselves down at a meeting hall in Philadelphia and de\ncided that George IIII was devine by his own grace and\nnot by the grace of God. And of that group none were\nwilder than a Virginia gentleman by the name of Jeffer\nson. who had gone into Yankee country from his home\ndown around Charlottsville.\nNow, this man was a radical of the first order. It was\nhe who proclaimed su<& ideas as that of all men being\nequal, at least under God; furthermore, he thought that\npeople should have the right to freedom of speech, free\ndom to worship God in their own way, freedom to write\nand publish what they pleased . . . Heavens! the guy was\njust loaded with screw-ball notions.\nIn my mind there is great doubt that Jefferson\nwould not have taken the line of thinking he did could\nhe have but seen into the future . . . especially around\nhis own Charlottsville in 1957 A.D. No doubt about it, the\npoor old man has turned over in his grave a number of\ntimes in these past few years.\nAnd the .reason is simple. It is because of a small,\nsweet, innocent appearing lady named Sarah Patton\nBoyle who, in her own way, is as much a hell raiser as\nold Tom ever dreamed of being, which, incidentally, he\n. wasn\u2019t, not in comparsion to her.\nPatty is a female who has taken literally the ab\nstract ideas set forth by radical Tom. She relates them\nto our own times, and to her own community, in which\"\nthe University of Virginia is located. (Patty\u2019s husband.\nDr. Roger Boyle, is on the faculty at the University. And\nto him I have sent my sincere sympathy several times.)\nPersonally, I can\u2019t decide if Patty is one of those\npeople who has one foot in a cloud and the-other on the\nground, or weather that other foot is on a banana peel.\nHowever, I am of the opinion that she isn\u2019t too concern\ned where the second foot is so long as people, regardless\nof race, creed, or color are treated as human beings, un\nder God and under the law of the land. Such a persons\nis dangerous and hard to cope with, as any number of\npersons have found out.\nMost women speak their minds freely, but usually\nthey restrict themselves to their husbands, as most any\n(Continued On Page Two)\nI\nWatch On The\nPOTOMAC\nby\nRobi. G. Spivack\n|\n1 \" -\nTHE MAN BEHIND THE'\nCOURT \u2014 There is little doubt\nin the minds of Washington\u2019s\nmost distinguished correspon\ndentg that the recent \u201ccivil\nrights\u201d decisions of the U. S.\nSupreme Court mark a turning\npoint in American history so\nfar as interpretation of the U.\nS. Constitution is concerned.\nThe credit for forging a new\n\u201cliberal bloc\u201d in the Court is\ngenerally being given to Chief\nJustice Warren. There is no\ndoubt that he deserves the ac\ncolades or brickbats, depending\non where you sit. Warren, along\nwith Justices Black, Brennan,\nDouglas and Harlan now con\nstitute a clear \u201cliberal\u201d majority.\nBut there is another man, not \\\non the Court, whose role in the j\nEisenhower administration is be-\\\ning overlooked and he deserves j\nas much of the credit (or blame)!\nas anyone else for the turn of j\nevents. I refer to the Attorney j\nGeneral, Herbert Brownell, Jr.;\nSo far as 1 am concerned, Brow- j\nnell merits high praise for the!\npart he has played in moderniz- j\ning the Court- ---\nBrownell is the man responsi\nble for President Eisenhower\u2019s\nthree most distinguished ap\npointments to the Court, War\nren, Harlan and Brennan. He\nnot only had the responsibility\nfor heking their backgrounds in\nhis capacity as head of the Jus\ntice Dept., he also inevitably\nbore responsibility for finding\nout their social and political\noutlookk on the modern world.\nAlthough we pride ourselves on\nliving under a system based on\nlaw, not men\u2019s whims, the fact\nis that Justices of the Court are\nI men.\nThey have opinions, feelings,\nprejudices, and dreams just like\nother men. No matter how de\ntached they aim to make them\nselves, no judge can completely\n| divorce himself from normal\nhuman emotions or regard the\nlaw as an abstraction.\nIn making his recommenda\ntions to the President, Brownell\ncould have suggested some old\nRepublican mossbacks just as\neasily as men of the Warren\ncalibre. That he did not do so,\nis a tribute to his sense of his\ntory and responsibility.\nTHE TWO BROWNELLS \u2014I\nam as aware, perhaps more so,\nthan most of my fellow-corre\nspondents that Brownell is not a\nfavorite among the nation\u2019s li\nberals. He has been sharply\ncriticized for his part in the so\ncalled Harry Dexter White \u201cex\npose\u201d and his innuendoes link\ning former President Truman to\nSoviet agents. There are some\nwho feel that the Justice Dept,\nshows undue subservience to big\nbusiness. With these estimates\nI shall not quarrel.\nThere are others, recalling\nBrownell\u2019s role in the political\nwars, who say that \u201conce a politi\ncian, always a politician.\u201d With\nthis appraisal I do not agree.\nI have known Brownell during\n! most of his political life. Like any\nj other successful politician he does\n(Continued on Next Page)\nCBS Presented \u2014 * .J\nThe Comrade Who Was Late\nDuring the first week in June the Columbia Broadcasting Sys\ntem did a great public service for the citizens of this Nation by\npresenting Comarde Nikita Khrushchev on their telecast, \u201cFace The\nNation.\u201d\nThere are those who will not agree with us; indeed, there were\nthose who demanded to know if CBS cleared the program with any\none, and, it so, with whom. (A stupid thing to ask in a Nation which\nalfows a free press. Actually, we wish they could line up an inter\nview with the Devil sometime within the near future.)\nThe telecast set off a chain-reaction, commencing in Washing\nton, and heard from Maine to Califorina . . . good and loud. Ike,\nthe only man ever to retire into the Presidency of the United States,\nconsidered making a reply* to Comrade Khrushchev, but decided a\ngainst it for some reason.\nWe\u2019ve not been able to figure out why such rumblings were\nheard in this land ... we only know they were. In one of his state\nments, perhaps the Comrade came*too close for comfort.\n(Plight here and now let us make ourselves clear. We do not\napprove of Communism, Socialism, Totempoleism, or anything by\nany name which would subjugate the will of the individual to that\nof the government, no matter what or why.)\nIt seems the one statement by Krushchev which caused more\nnoise among us than anything else was \u201cyour grandchildren in\nAmerica will live under Socialism.\u201d\nWell, now, ain't that something! And it is for this reason that\nwe believe CBS did a great public service: They showed that the\nComrade was at least a quarter century behind the times. This we\nsay because of his statement about our grandchildren. We hold, to\na degree, that our generation is the one of which he should have\nspoken, although he was no doubt right, up to a point.\nIn behalf of our arguement we\u2019d like to point out that, at this\nmoment, our Nation is just short of being a paternalistic welfare\nstate, which, right or wrong, to our mind this seems slightly Social\nistic.\nSome facts: ______\nThe Federal Government owns approximately 25% of the land\nin the United States.\nThe Federal Government own housing projects and business\nproperties worth about $50 billion.\nThe Federal Government owns sufficient power producing facil\nities to furnish one-fourth of the needed power for the entire na\ntion.\nWith the Social Security program, the Federal Government is\nthe nation\u2019s largest insurance company.\nThe Federal Government has the undisputed power to tell an\nemployer the minimum he can pay employees.\nThe Federal Government can tell a farmer what he can and\nwhat he cannot plant, and in what amounts. (The farmer can still\ndecide where to plant it, however.)\nThrough its controlling powers, the Federal Government has\ntransferred to itself approximately one-half of the value of all\nprivate property in the nation.\nFurther, in our opinion, we are practicing Socialism by virtue\nof the fact that what the Federal Government doesn\u2019t own, it con\ntrols in one way or another.\nAnd as matters now stand, if we continue our pi-esent course,\nit\u2019s only a matter of time until the Federal Government tells a wo\nman when she can give birth to a baby. (On a co-op basis, of\n\u2022coui\u2019se.) *\nWe believe also that in due course of time the Government will\neither own or most definitely conti'ol all the basic industries in the\nNation; also, as we see it. medicine is not far from complete Govern\nment control. 7\ninese tilings nave come about, are going to come about, for\nJ two basic reasons. First, individuals given the right to do as they\ni fairley well please, go hog wild. They forget that with their great\n! freedom goes a responsibility. Slowly, but surely, the wealth finds\nI its way into a few hands, bringing about an unfortunate situation\nwhich has resulted in what we\u2019ve pointed out above. Second, this\nis indeed one world in which we live. As a Nation we have to com\npete with Nations who don\u2019t see things the way we do. In a time of\nNational emergency they don\u2019t have to wait until everyone is happy\nwith his lot before he\u2019ll act. To a degree, we do. Result: Govern\nment control, more and more.\nActually, we do not condemn such projects as TVA or Social\n! Security. The good, we think, is greater than the fear of the theory,\ni We would not object to some sort of National Medical Insurance,\nnor would we object to some sort of control, firmer than it now is.\nover basic industry, which, in many cases, is pretty well in the hands\nof a few.\nIt would seem, to a degree at any rate, that complete and total\nfreedom of the individual is his undoing. We hold with the individ\nual freedom completely, except where the public interest is concern\ned. In short, all of us are more important than a few of us.\nIn any event, the Comrade was a little late. For, as we see it,\nthe grandchildren are already there . . . and are going to be more\nso in the years to come.\nWell, that\u2019s that. And this is an invitation to you to drop in on\n: our investigation when we get hauled in for being a Commie, which\nj is likely, seeing as to how we\u2019re guilty by association, having read\nI about the TV appearance of Comrade Khrushchev."}, {"title": "coolidge examiner.", "city": ["Coolidge"], "date": "19450330", "raw_text": "Page Six\nCooli\nPUBLISHED EVERY FRIDAY MORNING\nEntered as second-class matter March 7, 1830 at the post office at\nCoolidge, Arizona, under the Act o*.

Cat\nAre Your Children Safe?\nFatal accidents in the home, to American children of\npre-school age, have increased 40'since the war began,\naccording to life insurance statisticians.\nWhile we have been lamenting over the fate of children\nin war-torn Europe, we evidently haven\u2019t been giving\nenough attention to the fate of children in our own land.\nThere seems to be little we can do, tor the moment, about\nthe children in foreign cities, but there is no good excuse\nfor this increased mortality here.\nThe reasons are obvious. Mothers, busy with jobs or\nwork, are taking too many chances with their child\nren. They are leaving them under the care of neighbors\nwho are already over-busy caring for their own children,\nor are leaving them with older brothers and sisters who\ndo not have a proper sense of responsibility.\nHalf of the home accident are caused by burns and\nscalds\u2014a lot of them due to children\u2019s natural yearn\ning to play with matches. Others are caused by\nswallowing poisons and by falls.\nThe increase goes to prove that it isn\u2019t safe to leave a\nsmall child alone, or without proper supervision. Although\nwomen are need in war work, it isn\u2019t safe for a mother\nof a youngster to be away from home unless she can pro\nvide really adequate care for her children.\nTire Shortage\nWatch your tires.\nAll studies of the situation point clearly to the fact that\nthis is going to be far the worst year yet, so far as getting\nnew tires is concerned. And there are millions of tires,\nright now, worn to the bursting point.\nGO along any of our highways for a few miles and\nthe chances are you will see several cars with flats.\nThis summer it is going to be much worse.\nThere are only two ways we can skim by this summer,\nso far as tires are concerned. One is to take the best\npossible care of tires and drive as little as possible. The\nother is to cut production of tires needed for army trucks\nand planes. Yes, there are two possibilities\u2014but only\none choice which any of us w'ould take.\nVALLEY MEMORIAL PARK\nIs Located In The Simple\nDignity and Grace of Quiet Surroundings\nFor Reservations of Lots\nCALL 62\nCOLE and MAUD\nMortuary\nattention]\nFARMERS!:\nWE HAVE ON HAND *\nfor Immediate Delivery without Priority *\nGOBLE DISC HARROWS |\nAll Sizes\nTWO-WHEEL\nBroadcast Seeders I\nCockshutt Plows J\nAtlas Land Levelers and Scrapers I\nGEHL Hammer Mills \u201d\nand CULTIVATOR STEELS I\nCome in or Phone\nfor Any Kind of Farm Machinery 5\nNEIL B.

At\nthe present moment, partly because\nof the war, it is a mixture of social\nism, communism, dictatorship, cap\nitalism and what might be describ\ned as Americanism.\nWhat it\u2019s going to be after the\nwar is up to you and me and the\nboys who have been fighting this\nwar. But I am very much afraid\nthat we will end up with some\n\u201cism\u201d which is a \u2018 far cry from\nAmericanism unless we take a\nmuch more active interest in\npreserving the things which our\ncountry has stood for in the past.\nThe trouble is that unless\nnew theories of government are\nlabeled as \u201ccommunistic\u201d or\n\u201csocialistic\u2019\u2019 a lot of us don't\nrecognize them and don\u2019t as\nsociate them with these for\neign philosophies. In fact, ma\nny of us are becoming very\nfond of some of the proposals\nwhich appear to guarantee us\nnew security or better living\nconditions, but which are def\ninitely in the \u201cism\u201d class.\nSocialized medicine, fore exam\nple if put to a vote, might right\nnow win the support of the majority\nof people.

Opponents of Labor\npoint to Britain as a horrible ex\nample of rushed socialism. They\nseek to check the flood of free\nsocial benefits and the trend to\nward more nationalization and\ncontrols.\nNew Zealand will vote in a new\nParliament November 30. Ten\ndays later, on December 10, 5,000,\n000 Australians will pick their\nnext Parliament.\nA general election is held once\nevery three years in both these\nBritish dominions.\nLabor in Control.\nIn both countries the outgoing\nParliaments have been controlled\nby the Labor Party. Both Labor\ngovernments have pushed social\nwelfare benefits and nationaliza\ntion.\nElectors of both countries now\nare asking themselves:\nDo we want more government\nhandouts, with high taxes to pay\nfor them?\nWill the opposition give us the\nsame high standard of living we\nhave had under Labor?\nDo we want the government to\nrun more industries instead of\nprivate enterprise?\nWill the opposition be able to\nkeep up the present full employ\nment? Or will there be fewer\njobs with longer working hours\nand maybe less pay?\nWhich party will be able to cut\nliving costs and not cut wages?\nWhich will build the most houses\nand apartments?\nThere a few side issues: but\nIt is what the candidates say\nabout socialism and living costs\nthat will win votes.\nAim at \"Swing voters\nCandidates are directing their\ncampaign at the middle class\n\"swing\u201d voters. These are the\npeople who vote either way, and\nreally decide who will govern.\nThese groups in Australia and\nNew Zealand are not large. They\ncomprise mainly small farmers and\ntradesmen, clerks and some other\nwhite collar workers. \u2022\nAll signs indicate that the elec\ntions are going to be close in both\ncountries.\nLabor perhaps is a little more\nlikely to lose in New Zealand\nthan in Australia. Here in Aus\ntralia they are saying the result\nis an even money bet either way.\nThere are 80 seats in the New\nZealand parliament. Four of these\nare for Maoris, the original New\nZealanders. Labor-supporting Ma\noris usually are returned.\nThere are four labor Maoris in\nthe retiring* parliament. Their\nsupport has kept Prime,, Minister\nPeter Fraser in power.\nThe Labor and NattpgR&t\nparties each have 38 seats.\nBigger Edge in Australia\nLabor Maoris likely will win\nfour seats again this election.\nThat means the Nationalists have\nto win three of the \u201cEuropean\u201d\nLabor seats to gain power.\nLabor has a bigger margin in\nAustralia. Official Labor had 43\nof the 74 seats in the last parlia\nment. The Liberals had 17 seats,\nthe Country Party 12, and Inde\npendent Labor 2.\nThe Liberal and Country par\nties work as a united opposition\nto Labor in the federal parlia\nment.\nFor this election the number\nof seats in the Australian House\nof Representatives has been in\ncreased to 121. Each member in\nthe new house will represent\nabout 42,000 electors.\nVoting is compulsory in Aus\ntralia. Perhaps that helps Labor\nbecause otherwise many men and\nwomen who give their votes to\nLabor would not bother to vote.\nEVENING PANNING\n40* \u2018nr,/0\nCAPITAL GARAGE\n1320 N. Y.

Tousley\nGeneral Manager\nSplit of Socialists j\nOver Marshall Plan J\nBelieved Unlikely |\nBy Helena Huntington Smith |\nWARSAW, (by airmail) .\u2014The 1\nSocialists of the eastern bloc don\u2019t |\npropose to split with their western 1\ncolleagues over the Marshall Plan. |\nInstead they will remain in the inter- |\nnational Socialist organization and |\nwork for the unity of Europe, unless |\nfuture action by the western Social- |\nists themselves makes a split inevit- |\nable. : |\nStanislaw Szwalbe, vice marshall ||\nof the Polish parliament and chair- |\nman of the general council of the \u00a7\nPolish Socialist Party, made these \u00a7\nstatements to the writer. He set at |\nrest the rumors and alarms growing |\nout of last month's London confer- |\nence of the Comisco\u2014Permanent |\nCommittee of International Social- \u00a3\n1st Conferences\u2014which indicated |\nthat the eastern Socialists were un- \u00a7\nder Communist pressure to with- I\ndraw from further participation and |\nthus make the cleavage between |\neast and west complete.\nOnly two Socialist parties are left I\nalive and functioning in Eastern |\nEurope today\u2014in Poland and Hun- 1\ngary\u2014those of Romania and Bui- |\ngaria having been rather completely 1\nliquidated, the party in Czechoslo- |\nvakia having become powerless, and |\nthe party in Yugoslavia never having 1\nbeen permittted to exist. Thus if. |\nthe rumors were true and the east- |\nern Socialists were obliged to with- |\ndraw from the conferences, it would I\nmean tne nnai eclipse ot socialism $\nas an International force in Europe. |\nRumors Denied.\nBut Mr. Szwalbe denied the ru- \u00a7\nmors, saying: \u201cThere is no more I\nlikelihood of a split among the So- |\ncialists over the Marshall Plan than 1\nthere was a split in the World\nFederation of Trade Unions over-it,\ndespite Intense disagreements. We\nare for other forms of aid to Europe.\nWe don\u2019t completely approve of the\nMarshall Plan because it demands\npolitical subservience from the coun\ntries taking part.\n\u201cThe Comintern won\u2019t force a\nsplit because it recognizes too well\nthe part played by the Eastern\nSocialists in influencing the West\nern Parties and holding them in\nline.\" -<\u2022'\nHe cautioned, however, that there\nwere certain actions on the part of\nthe Western Socialists that could\ncause a split, and that \u201cUnity\ndoesn\u2019t depend entirely on our atti\ntudes in the East.\" One such aotion\nwould be to behave like the German\nSocialists of 1914 who voted for the\nmilitary credits of Kaiser Wilhelm,\nor like those French Socialists who\nsupported Marshal Petain.\nSplit is Possible.\n\u201cIf the Western Socialists show :\nthat their main aim is to support\nWestern imperialists instead of\nworking sincerely for European\nunity and the aims of Socialism in\nEurope\u2014then there will be a split.\n\u201cAlso, we don\u2019t like to hear too\nmuch about the Third Force\u2014which*\nseems t.n he nnlv * risirire fnr vwlrJ\nIng with Imperialism and capital# I\nism. ' I\n\"If the Western parties try tfe 1\ncreate an instrument whose matin 1\npurpose is directly combating cord-4 J\nmunism, that also would be cauIdH\nfor a split because there in Poland w\nwe think we cannot realize the aims 1\nof socialism without communism? 11\n\u2019\u201cThere will be a split, too, if,the I\nWestern Socialists try to force is in If\nthe East ^to have good relations 1\nwith Franco, as Blum is trying to 1\nBut a split over the Marshall\nPlan? No.\"\nHopes for Loan. 4\nSpeaking as a Pole and not just\nas a Socialist, Mr. Szwalbe voiced!\nthe hope for a loan to his country,\nfrom the International Bank or\nfrom the United States, to buy coal\nmining machinery, a hope which\nunites all Poles without regard for\nparty. With such a loan, he pointed\nout, Poland would increase \u201cher ex\nports of coal to all countries ir\nrespective of politics, and thus\nwould be in the paradoxical position\nof helping to make tfce Marshall\nPlan a success. -\n\"We\u2019ve been waiting three years\nfor credits to restore our mining in\nstallations, while Germany has been\nreceiving new tools, new machines\nand credits without any apparent\ndifficulty,\u2019\u2019 he added.\nA meeting of Western Socialists\ninterested in the Marshall Plan is\nscheduled to takqf place on Anglo\nFrench invitation in March. Mr.\nSzwalbe said that some time in the\nspring, when a date could be ar\nranged, there would be a corre\nsponding conference of Eastern\nSocialists who are opposed, with the \u00a7\nItalian party included. But he in- 1\ndicated that there was no hurry 1\nabout it. 1\n(Released by The Bell Syndicate, Inc.) $\u25a0;\nBancroft Square Dance |\nTo Be Held Tomorrow\nThe Mouiit Pleasant Citizen!

Poles hate the Soviet\nUnion, yet a successful Polish\ngovernment today must be\nlinked with Russia.\n3. Most Poles are not Social\nists, and they have little en\nthusiasm for \"building social- j\nism.\u201d\n4. The Polish economic sys\ntem is Socialist, but there is\nno indication that doctrinaire\nsocialism will be able to solve\nPoland\u2019s economic problems.\n8. The people are determined\nto keep their freedom, includ\ning the freedom not to co-op\nerate when they don\u2019t want to.\n6. Poles want fast improve\nment in their standard of liv\ning, but even under the most\nhappy economic and political\ncircumstances progress will be\npainfully slow.\n7. Poland lacks leaders. The\nGermans and Russians for 15\nyears systematically \u201cliqui\ndated\u201d Poles who showed abil\nity for moral or Intellectual\nleadership. There is a general\ncontempt for government or\nany authority in Poland today.\ni In other words, to sum up\nthe difficulties the Polish Com\nmunist Party faces, the regime\nis trying to put over an un\npopular political system and a\nperhaps unworkable economic\nsystem, both efforts handi\ncapped by the determination\non the part of the regime to\nmaintain national indepen\ndence and personal freedom.\nFavorable Forres\nThere are of course import\ntant forces working for the\nparty:\n1. Poles believe they will be\nslaughtered like Hungarians if\nthey don\u2019t keep a Soviet-ap\nproved Communist government\n2. The Catholic Church\u2014\nthe only widely supported force\nin Poland\u2014accepts the present\nCommunist regime as the only\nalternative to revolution and\na return to the old teiror sys\ntem.\n3 The new Communist re\ngime is showing signs of flexi\nbility which may in fact carry\nit to a workable economic and\npolitical system, even though\nin theory the party remains\ntrue-Red Communist.\n4. Poles are tired of stress,\nof Instability, of bloodshed.\nThey don\u2019t want to fight the\nCommunists again.\n5. The Polish people are not\nj without hope: they believe the\nSoviet Union and the whole\nCommunist bloc is changing for\nI the better. Poles believe the\nworld eventually will be a safe\nplace for a fully democratic\nPoland, so there Is no need for\ndesperation today.\n6. Many countries in the\nWest and in the Soviet camp\nwant to see the Polish experi\nment succeed and will continue\nto give Important Ideological\nand financial aid.\nAnd so. the Communist\nParty has working in its favor\n(he widespread conviction that\nPoland has no other place to\ngo, plus the hope among Poles\nthat things will continue to get\nbetter.\nWhat Lies Ahead\nThen what is the future of\nthe new Polish regime?\nThis is a favorite question of\noutsiders in Poland, but the\nPoles themselves seem to avoid\nworking out the answer. One\nPole put it to me this way:\n\"We don\u2019t make detailed\nplana about the future here, j\n\u25a0 We have learned during the\ni German occupation and then\n' the Stalinist days that it is\nuseless to look ahead. We get\nwhat we can out of today.\n\u201cOs course, we hope things\nwill get better, and we hope\nwe don\u2019t lose our freedom. But\nit doesn't seem very important\nto wonder what kind of govern\nment we will have a few years\nfrom now.\u201d\nVisitors who like to worry\nabout the future on behalf of\nthe Poles generally conclude\nthat the party, itself, has no\nreal long-range plans\u2014just\nplenty of ideas wrapped up in\nthe strange artificial language\nof communism, and not even\nthe party officials can agree on\nwhat the ideas will mean in\npractice.\nThe people, on the other\nhand, may be against com\nmunism, but they don't, seem\nto know just what they would\nlike.\nSome Key* to the Future\nActually, the future for\nPoland seems to rest on several\nunanswered questions:\nHow long will the people re\nmain patient under an un\npopular government and a\nlimping economic system?\nIf the party must some day\neither reapply terror to main\ntain lta rule or sacrifice com\nmunism In order to maintain\nfreedom, which will the party\nchose?\nWill the Soviet Union permit\nthe Polish people to lose\npatience? Or will the Kremlin\npermit the Polish Communlsf,\nParty to water down classic\nCommunist doctrine.\nPoles both In and out of the\nparty believe the recent changes\nin Moscow\u2014the ouster of \"con\nservative\u201d Communist officials\n\u2014widens the scope of choice in\nPoland.\nFrom the Polish point of\nview, the essence of the Krem\nlin change is that Russia now\naffirms the right of all Com\nmunist states to have their own\nindependent brands of com\nmunism. The Polish party sees\nit as a green light to unlimited\nflexibility within the frame\nwork of the Marx-Lenin-Engles\ntextbooks. And those textbooks\ncan be made to say almost any\nthing one would like to hear.\nFlexibility would not extend,\nof course, to the admission of\nopposition parties capable of\nousting the Communists from\npower.\nBest of What I* Necessary\nThe people would like free\ndom of choice to be extended\nmuch farther. The Polish Com\nmunist regime of Party Sec\nretary Oomulka is tolerated\nonly because today the Polea\nmust have a Communist gov\nernment. and hia la the beat\nthey know of. If the Poles had\ntheir choice, it ia quite prob\nable they would throw out the\nCommunist government tomor\nrow and substitute for it . . .\nwell, they don\u2019t seem to know\nJust what.\nBut the desires of party and\npeople combined with political\nand economic realities in Po\nland seem to be leading Poland\nin one general direction: Addi\ntion of more and more cap\nitalistic features to the Polish\neconomy and growth of in\ncreasingly vocal opposition\ngroups preaching political lib\neralization within and without\nthe party.\nNo one, of course, expects to\nsee Western-style political and\neconomic freedom In Poland as\nlong as communism remains\nthe way of life In Russia. But at\nthe aame time no one even\nCommunist Party officials\nsays a reversal of the present\nliberal trend Is possible\nNo one knows whether Poland\neventually can produce \u201ca kind\njof socialism people can like\"\nBut already Poland has pro\nduced something new under\nthe sun, and the country al\nready Is vastly better off be\ncause of It.\nSubsequent articles In this\nseries will take up the question\nof what's new in Polish eeo\nomics, foreign policy and civil\nliberties and attempt, above all,\nto show whM It Is like to be a\nPole living today In this new\njklnd of Communist state.\nTomorrow Ultimo<! hrlpi ktop Pa-\nIm4 Cs\"\u00ab\u00ab\u2022\u00ab it tod try*."}, {"title": "ottawa county news.", "city": ["Port Clinton"], "date": "19520829", "raw_text": "\u2022GENOA NEWS\nSixty members of Cochran Ma\njorettes, will appear in Genoa\nSaturday as part of a good will\ntour of the county.

Writing against\nsocialism, I am like a farmer\nspraying his Aelds against a plague\nof insects. Everyone of us knows\nthat when such menaces come they\nhave to be wiped out *before any\nthing else can be don\u00e9.\nplace unless a lot of other good\nwork had been done, starting with\nthe preparation of the soil itself.\nMoreover, even after the insects\nhave been killed, cultivation of the\nAeld must still go on.\nIn the same way, we Aght against\nsocialism to keep it from destroy- i\ning our free enterprise system. Yet,\nspraying the Reds is only a pro- i\ntective measure after all. it saves i\nour system from one type of men-1\nace. Just as crops fail from many !\ncauses, the free enterprise system\nis also subject to many dangers.\nAnd the greatest danger of all\narises when the people of a nation\nplay follow-the-leader instead of\nsetting their own course for them\nselves.\nIn a recent article, I made the\npoint that in recent years we\nAmericans have let Washington\nmake toe many decisions for us.\nI mean that instead of sending\npeople to Washington to do deAnite\nthings for us, we have relied on\nWashinglon to tell us what to do.\nIn another article, I pointed out\nthat Politicians do not actually\nlead a nation, but instead, try to\nplease a majority of voters.\nNow when the majority of voters\nare confused, and therefore fail to\ntake clear positions, party leaders\ntry to assemble a majority of their\nown. They do this by granting spe\ncial treatment to speciAc groups\nwithin our nation. In short, they\nuse the power of government in an\neffort to sway huge blocks of\nvotes\u2014the labor unions, or the\nfarmers, or some religious or ra\ncial minorities, or anyone else.\nThis clearly is what has been\nhappening in America in recent\nyears. The groups, as groups, have\nreceived certain beneAts. But the\nnation, as a nation, has become di\nvided on class and occupational\nlines.\nWe, the people, are ourselves to\nblame for most of this.\nNever before in the history of\nthis country has there been so\ngreat a need for the people to re\nexamine their situation, and reach\ntheir own decisions.\nIn this Presidential year, we will\nall have to vote more or less blind\nly, accepting one party or the\nother more or less as such party\nroughly and approximately stands\nfor what we want, or opposes what\nwe dislike. A vote on November\n' 4th will be a vote for a \"package\"\nrather than a vote for every item\nin that package. But when the next\nCongress convenes, we will all have\na fresh opportunity to consider our\nmajor problems singly and care\nfully, one at a time, as bills are\nintroduced.\nIt will be the clear duty of every\nAmerican to have an opinion on\nevery major point, and to make\nthat opinion known to his repre\nsentatives.\nThat way\u2014and that way only\u2014\ncan representative government and\ngenuine free enterprise Aourish.\n*\nUgh 1 Squid-Squished\nDrain!\n%\nSOUTH BEND, Ind. \u2014 (\u00c6*) \u2014\nMrs. Louise Johnson, 27, of South\nMain street was surprised when\nshe pulled a baby squid from a\nclogged lavatory drain in her home.\nLegs nf the 10-legged member of\nthe octopus family wound around\nher Anger when she poked It into\nthe drain to investigate.\nDr. John D.

X. Mc\nGohey asked Green:\n\"If you desired, could you stand\nup in Red Square and denounce\nsocialism, defend capitalism and\ndenounce Stalin?\u201d\nInstead of answering the ques\ntion immediately, Green insisted\nthat there were limitations on\nfree speech in this country, too.\nHe quoted from a 1938 pamph\nlet in which he stated that work\ners in the United States may be\n\"given the means to speak to a\nhandful\u201d of persons in a public\nsquare or meeting hall, but that\nthe \"capitalist class controls the\nmeans to speak to millions\"\nthrough the press and radio.\nQuestion Is Repeated.\u201d\nMr. McGohey.repeated his ques\ntion. adding, \"How about it,\nnow?\u201d\nGi^en said that \"independent\nfreedom is not and never has\nbeen an unlimited freedom.\u201d\n\"In other words,\u201d said Mr. Mc\nGohey. \"the answer to that ques\ntion about denouncing socialism\nin Red Square is no?\u201d\nDefense attorneys objected in\nvain. Green shifted in his seat,\nand said:\n\"The answer is no.\u201d\nUnder cross-examination, Green\nalso admitted that he wrote an\narticle 15 years ago in which he\nurged American reds to work \"for\nthe overthrow of the American\ncapitalism and for a Soviet\nAmerica.\u201d\nUrged Military Science.\nOther excerpts from the article,\nread to the court by Mr. McGohey,\nsaid that \u201cmilitary science is in\ndispensable to proletarians\u2019\u2019 and\nwas not to be used for \u201cshooting\nyour own brothers\u201d but \u201cto learn\nto fight against the bourgeoisie\nof your own country.\u201d\nGreen, who denied in his direct\ntestimony that he ever advocated\nthe violent overthrow of the Gov\nernment, said he wrote the article\nin 1934 when he was an official\nof the Young Communist League.\nDefense attorneys protested the\nprosecution's introduction of the\narticle, claiming it was written\nbefore the passage, of the Smith\nAct in 1940, under which the 11\nRed leaders are charged.\nThey also claimed the article\npreceded the period covered by\nthe indictment, which accuses the\ndefendants of conspiring since\n1945 to advocate the forcible over\nthrow of the Government.\nFederal Judge Harold R.

Hemenway, who\nhad issued an order forbidding the\nhiring of Negro substitute teach\ners, rescinded the order after he\nwas advised by the state industrial\ncommission that it violated the Wis\nconsin fair employment act.\n.Rahn\u2019s letter also said: \u201cWe\nshould not only preach, but practice\nunderstanding and tolerance to\nward all groups, irrespective of re\nligious belief or racial origin.\u201d\nIMPATIENCE, SELFISHNESS\n9\nAs long as there is a balance be\ntween production and consumption,\nsuch economic phenomena as infla\ntion and deflation are impossible.\nThis is just another way of saying\nthat so long as there is a balance\nbetween supply and demand our\neconomic ship of state keeps an\neven keel. War upsets this propit\nious economic balance of our econ\nomy by decreasing production for\ncivilian consumption. Production\nfor war purposes greatly increases\nthe amount of money in circulation.\nThis increased amount of money\nmeans increased purchasing power\nin the face of decreasing stocks of\nconsumers goods. Price rises be\ncome inevitable. Those engaged in\nwar time production can pay the\nincreased prices because they re\nceive war-time or increased wages.\nWith war\u2019s termination matters\nare greatly complicated by the fact\nthat an abundance of money is par\nalleled by a relative scarcity of con\nsumers goods which results in high\ner and higher prices. If the situa\ntion is to be relieved it must be\nthrough increased production rath\ner than through increased wages or\npurchasing power.\nThe country today is facing this\nsituation of getting production in\ncreased. The capitalists say in or\nder to increase production, prices\nmust be increased as a pump\nprimer. The labor interests say\nthat wages must be increased to\nmeet these risihg prices. We thus\nare face to face with a situation\nwhere higher prices which business\nis demanding call for higher wages\nwhich labor is demanding.\nHence we have the economic\nprice-wages spiral which heads into\ninflation which brings national dis\naster to capital and labor as such,\nand to the nation as a whole. The\nonly fundamental question before\nthe country is, shall we correct our\neconomic disorder by increased\nproduction or by increased wages?\nWe must begin somewhere but\nwhere? is the question.\nBecause the capitalistic interests\nare at greater advantage than the\nlabor interests, the capitalists\nshould make the first move by in\ncreasing production without an in\ncrease in price and this would\nmake increased wages unnecessary.\nBut the capitalists seem deter\nmined in far too many instances to\nuse the current menacing situation\nto their own advantage and there\nfore refuse to increase production\nBulletin\n.DAILY\nCombined With THE OHIO EXPRESS\nONE OF THE TWO ONLY N EGRO DAILIES 1 N I WORLD\nVol. 4\u2014No. 360 DAYTON, OHIO.

The unanimous vote\nof the Senate foreign relations committee in reporting\nout the aid bill, with amendments that should help clar\nify and strengthen it, is a significant straw in the wind.\nIn the meantime, the debate on the Truman doctrine\ngoes on all over the world.\nAt its recent conference, the British Co-Operative\nparty, which claims a membership of 8 million and is\naffiliated with the Labor movement, approved a resolu\ntion denouncing the new trend in American foreign pol\nicy.\nThe debate preceding the vote on this resolution re\nflected the alarm that has been aroused in left-wing cir\ncles in Great Britain over the possibility of a permanent\nbreach between east and west. It is precisely for the\nsame reason that an important minority of the Labor\ncontingent in the House of Commons has taken an in\ncreasingly critical attitude toward the policies pursued\nby Ernest Bevin.\nThe Co-Operators turned down a resolution demand\ning the suspension of conscription and another that\nwould have put the movement on record as in favor of\na substantial reduction in the British defense budget.\nTo have approved such resolutions would in effect,\nhave meant a repudiation of the Labor government. In\nstead, the delegates took it out on the United States.\nThe argument that the Truman policy regarding\nGreen and Turkey will widen the breach between Rus\nsia and the west is one frequently met in this country,\ntoo. It happens to be based on fallacious assumption that\nthis breach\u2014it has been growing steadily since the end\nof the war\u2014will be healed only if the west is careful not\nto oppose the Soviet Union.\nThe truth of the matter is that it was precisely such an\neasygoing policy that has brought the world to its pres\nent pass. From Teheran to Potsdam and on through the\nMoscow conference of 1945 and the two Paris confer\nences of the council of foreign ministers in 1946, many\nmajor and a host of minor concessions were made by the\nUnited States and Great Britain to Russia. Such a policy\ndid not make for peace in the world or even good rela\ntions between east and west.\nDespite the clamor of left-wing critics, the indications\nare that the Truman doctrine has attracted a consider\nable degree of support abroad. That support will grow\nonce it has become clear that the new American policy\nmeans the strengthening and not the weakening of the\ninternational order, one of whose chief pillars is the\nUnited Nations.\nThe United States is capable of serving as a great\nmagnet to like-minded nations. But to do its world task\neffectively it must stand for something. The anti-Com\nmunist aspect of American policy is attracting the great\nest amount of attention.\n1T0 be fully effective, our policy must be positive, con\nstructive, dynamic. It must be a doctrine of advocacy,\naiming at the perpetuation and expansion of the demo\ncratic idea.\nEnlightened Labor Policy\n(New York Times)\nLABOR UNIONS have come in for so much criticism\nin recent months that it is a genuine source of pleasure\nwhen the opportunity arises to say something of a com\nmendatory nature.\nSuch an opportunity is presented in the case of the\nMinnesota Federation of Labor (AFL). During the first\nten months of 1946. a year that produced a record crop\nof labor disputes, the 125,000 members of this group lost\nonlv about, one-fourth of 1 per cent of working time as a\nresult of strikes. Moreover, the record was no accident.\nIt was an accurate reflection of the enlightened point of\nview of this organization.\nMembers of the Minnesota Federation of Labor have\nthe good sense to realize that a policy of union responsi\nbility is an asset and that it pays dividends by attracting\ngood firms to the state. Thus, while many other unions\nwere raising funds to carry on campaigns for wages in\nexcess of the Government ceilings then prevailing, the\nMinnesota Federation of Labor was soliciting nickels\nand dimes from its members so that it could raise\nenough money to acquaint business men all over the\ncountry with its successful record in the matter of in\ndustry disputes. Manufacturers were invited to write\nthe Federation and to seek its help in finding a desirable\nlocation in the state and in establishing mutually profit\nab^ labor relations.\nIf the unions of the nation as a whole in recent years\nhad based their policies on the philosophy of the Minne\nsota Federation of Labor remedial labor legislation\nwould not today be the Number One item on the Con\ngressional program. It might not even be on that pro\ngram.\ni -\nAttention, Henrv:\n(Rocky Mountain News)\nHENRY WALLACE is running around England ex\nhording the British to oppose America\u2019s policy in regard\nto Greece and Turkey.

Jirttmm\n\u2014\nTROUBLE IN BRITAIN\nEngland has gone down for a\nsmall count. That of course is no\nreason why anybody should be\nready with the old \u201cI-told-you-so.\u201d\nHowever, some observations are in\norder. Outstanding Englishmen\nhave been outspoken during the\nfuel crisis in their country. An ex\namination of the underlying causes\nof the crisis in England ought to\nmake a good treatise favoring the\nAmerican economic system.\nIn England or anywhere else in\nthe world, it is my feeling that lit-1\ntie or nothing along the socialist\norder is to be found there that we\nwould wish to adopt in America.\nEven before the coal and power\ncrisis reached the terrible propor\ntions of mid-February, the British\nwere being urged by critics within\ntheir own realm to abandon plans\nfor further nationalization.\nNational Suicide?\nMr. Shinwell, minister of fuel\nand power, along with Sir Stafford\nCripps, president of the Board of\nTrade, asked that the country fore\ngo any further reorganization of\nthe electric power industry. The\nidea behind their plea was that\nBritish industry could not afford\nto be exposed to the uncertainties\nand hazards that would accompany\nmore experimentation. It was time\nStatehood Hearings\nIn Washington\n'Continued From Page One\ning of the Territory by statehood.\u201d\nCongressman Homer Angel of\nOregon, Henry D. Larcade, Jr., of\nLouisiana, Melvin Price of Illinois\nand Marion Bennett of Missouri,\nwho have travelled throughout the\nTerritory, were united in empha\nsising their convictions that Alas\nkans are entitled to immediate\nstatehood. They all admitted to\nsome doubts before visiting Alas\nka, but they testified those doubts\nwere replaced by strong convic\n\u2022ions on the side of statehood fol\nlowing their Alaska trips.\nMarion Bennett expressed his\nbelief in statehood by saying, in\npart \u2018\u2018It does not seem equitable\nhat American citizens who have\nshown themselves to be as politi\ncally mature as Alaskans have\nshould be deprived of a voice in\nthe Congress of the United States,\nor of the right to elect their gov\nernor. or to vote in Presidential\nelections. . . .

Another warning\ncame from a prominent religious\nleader. The English people were\nconfronted, he said, by immense\ndanger in the planned society be\ncoming so common. If more and\nmore orders had to be issued \u201cabout\nwhich the people would have to\nput up with and obey,\u201d it would be\nthe beginning of national suicide.\nResult of Planning\nThe British do not lack coal be\ncause they have no plan. Socialism\nis full of plans. The coal mines are\nthere, too. What socialism forgets,\nhowever, is that private and per\nsonal initiative, meaning hard work\nand high production, make up the\nfactors that insure economic sta\nbility. English miners can never\ndig coal with paper plans. Men dig\nand distribute coal to consumers of\nfuel largely because of various in\ncentives.\nNot the least of these incentives\nis that men make money in the\nprocess of getting the coal out of\nthe ground. But a nation does not\nget rid of monopoly by making the\nmonopoly one of government. The\nprime products of socialism and\ncommunism, with their monopolies\nof government, have been low\nstandards of living and meager\nproduction. Thing to remember is\nthat no anti-trust laws can reach\nthis kind of monopoly.\nBeet Statesmanship\nIt takes either revolution or\nworld conflict to sweep out failures\nof monopolistic government, once\nthey become entrenched by long\nhabit. But Americans will exercise\ngreat concern over the state of af\nfairs in England. No nation can\ncontinue indefinitely to weather\ncrises of this magnitude. If these\nthings herald the eventual break\nup of the British empire, they are\ntherefore of greatest seriousness to\nAmerica.\nIn any event responsibility falls\nwith increasing weight upon Amer\n1 ica. These duties lie most fully\nnow in the part we must play of\nmaking our free and dynamic econ\nomy, without taint of socialistic\nI experimentation, the example for\nI whole world.

C., under the laws of Congress, Act of Ma~ch 3, 1879\nEvery afternoon, Monday through Friday\nNo Secrets\nThere has been a very encouraging increase in the\nnumber of people who own stocks in American corporations\n\u2014the businesses which are the hub of our vast industrial\nmachine. And one of the best factors is that the great ma\njority of these shareowners are typical Americans, with\nmoderate incomes.\nHowever, many people still seem to think that there\nis something of a mystery involved in buying stocks\u2014that\nit\u2019s an activity which only should be followed by \u201cinsiders\"\nwith highly specialized knowledge and training. That mis\nconception needs clearing up.\nAnyone who wishes to may buy many or few shares\nof any stock listed on the exchanges oy the simple expedi\nent of going to a broker and placing his order. He call sell\nhis stock in the same fashion. There is no question about\nthe price\u2014it is a matter of public record as it goes up or\ndown or remains stationary from day to day. Nor does any\none \u201cfix\" tha> price\u2014 it is determined by what the seller is\nwilling to pay and the buyer is willing to accept, much in\nthe manner of an auction\u201d\nFurthermore, the prospective investor doesn't have\ntc work in the dark so far as selecting shares in this com\npany or that is concerned. State and national laws, and the\nregulations adopted by the principal stock exchanges, see\nto it that all pertinent information is readily available to\nanyone.\nThe people who own stock are partners in the Ameri\ncan economy. They have faith in the future. Most impor\ntant, they have a direct personal interest in preserving free\nenterprise and all the other freedoms at a time when every\neffort is being made to undermine them from within anil\nwithout.\nThe High Cost Os Socialism\nAccording to the Oregon Voter, 14 per cent of all the\nad valorum property tax levy in that state is paid by\npublic service enterprises\u2014power and light, railroad, and\ntelephone companies. This is entirely aside from the in\ncome taxes, corporation fees, franchise taxes, license fees,\nand all the rest of the levies they pay.\nThe situation is comparable in other states\u2014 in all\nparts of the country the public service companies are\namong the largest taxpayers, and are often the very larg\nest. And what gives this special interest is the fact that\nthe campaign to socialize the electric industry, and take\nits properties off the public tax rolls, is being pushed with\nunabated vigor by political groups.\nThe argument, of course, is that socialized power is\ncheaper power. That argument is strictly in the three\ndollar bill class. Survey after survey has shown that any\nrate advantage of publicly-owned as against privately\nowned utilities is made possible only by tax exemption\nand tax subsidies. On the average, the business-managed\npower companies pay out about 23 per cent of all their re\nvenues in taxes. The socialized operations either pay no\ntaxes at all, or comparatively small sums as token grants\nto states and municipalities. Every time a tax-paying en\nterprise is socialized, the tax burden of all other taxpay\ners must go uo. Socialism means political control over our\nlives and affairs\u2014a,nd we pay a big price in money to\nboot!\nFrederick OTHMAN\nWASHINGTON. I can't under\nstand why the Federal Trade Com\nmission didn\u2019t invite me and my\ndog, Emma, to its conferences on\nchlorophyl as a product to make\nthis best smelling of all possible\nworlds.\nWe arc experts on this subject.\nParticularly Emma. She docs not\nlike the stuff. Me. I can take it\nor leave it.\nThe government, claims that\nsome makers of chlorophyl have\nbeen too danged enthusiastic about\nthe ability of their product to make\neverybody, Emma included, smell\nsweet. Some rival manufacturers of\nnpn> green mouthwash simultan\neously have been advertising that\nchlorophyl is a fake. They point\nout that grass contains more chlo\nrophyl than anything else. Goats\neat grass. They still smell like\ngoats.\nThis, according to the trade com\nmissioners. is confusing to us cus\ntomers. So the manufacturers of\nchlorophyl pills, pastes, ointments\nand inner soies for shoes, to name\nonly a few. are about to be ordered\nhere to do some explaining and\ndemonstrating for the record.\nEmma and I, even if asked at\nthis late date, will be delighted to\nappear as friends of the court.\nEmma is a large poodle with a\ncoat the color of coffee and cream\nand plaintive brown eves. When\nshe's had a bath and the humidity\nremains high, she does not smell\nat all. Except, of course, when she's\nbeen chasing skunks.\nEven without skunks, however.\nEmma on vet days does not ex\nactly resemble a rose. I tried lo\nfeed her some of the original green\nchlorophyl pills, but she spurned\nthem. I dissolved them in milk,\n\u25a0which turned green and a little\npeppermints\u2019 and she'd have none\nof that, either.\nCana, then the benefactor,, of\ndog owners, stirring chlorophyl in\nto dog food, both dry and canned.\nThis Emma cannot escape. She eats\nchlorophyl or she doesn't eat.\nI give her a little meat, of course,\nalong with the medicated pup\nchowder and I regret to report that\nshe smells like she always smelled.\nShe rolled in the snow yesterday\nand when this melted in her fur,\nthe word for her. I believe, was\nhigh.\nMy own experience with chlo\nrophyl has been more disastrous\nSome of the first chlorophyl tooth\npaste I bought somehow got splash\ned on the bathroom wall. It also\ngot on my bride\u2019s best towels. It\nstill is on the wall; it remains to\nbe seen faintly after many wash\nings on the towels.\nWhen I mentioned this in an\nitem here a few months back, the\nmaker of another brand of green\ntoothpaste sent me six tubes of\nhis product, together with a letter\nsaying I was ruining him. He ad\nded that his chlorophyl was guar\nanteed washable. I have no doubt\nthat it is. but I cannot swear to\nit.\nMrs. O. was so bitter about her\ntowels turning green that I have\nused the full half-dozen packages\nwith such care not one smear\nof green has dribbled where it\nshouldn\u2019t. This. I know, is a min\nor matter to the trade commission.\nWhat it wants to learn is ex\nactly how I smell afer all this\nscientific testing. This is hard to\nsay. gentlemen. A lady cannot\nnotice her own perfume 10 minutes\nafter she puts it on. I suggest you\ncheck this with your own wives.\nObviously I do not know for sure\nwhat chlorophyl has done for me.\nbut I have one hint: Emma still\nis able to recognize me in the dark.\nShe does this with her nose, com\nmissioners I\u2019m still willing to be\npcivuacJcU on flit menu of cljlu-\nThese Days\n\u00a7 -\n\u00a3ekM ktf\nDEFINITIONS\nIt is so easy to pick an argument\nabout definitions. Yet when one\nsays the word, child, he does not\nmean a man of 50 with a beard.\nHowever, in the fields of politics\nor economics the tendency is to\nfoul through by fighting over pri\nvate definitions, each thinker com\ning up with his own.\n\u2022in the hope that there may be >\nRay of stating ideas with some\nclarity. I offer a few\u2019 definitions\nwhich seem to be standard:\nCapitalism: \u201c. . . . capitalism is\nan economic order based on the\nprofit motive: therefore its leading\ncharacteristics are the private own\nership of the means of production,\ntheir operation for pecuniary gain,\ntheir control by private enterpris\ners, and the use of credit and the\nwage system. . . \" (\"The Triumph\nof American Capitalism,\u201d by Louis\nM. Hacker.)\nFundamentally, this system re\nquires human freedom because in\nherent in it is the right of the in\ndividual to use his earnings accord\ning to his choice and conscience.\nSocialism: while the basic concept\nof Socialism is government owner\nship of the means of production,\ndistribution and exchange, the\nvarieties are many, ranging from\nthe mild reformist measures of the\nleft-wing New Dealers to the pre\nsent state of society in Soviet Rus\nsia. In effect. Socialists differ as to\nwhether their aims are to be achiev\ned by \u201cdemocratic\u201d means or by re\nvolution. depending upon their the\nory of the speed of change.\nAlthough numerous Utopian So\ncialist concepts exiseted prior t o\nKarl Marx, he and Frederick Engels\nfounded what has come to be\nknown as \u201cscientific\" Socialism, the\nbasis of which is the giologic as\nsumption of the struggle for exis\ntence which Marx accepted from\nthe writing of Charles Darwin and\nThomas Huxley. Applying these\nideas to politics, economics and so\nciology. they evolved the Class\nStruggle:\n\"The history of all hitherto ex\nisting society is the history of class\nstruggles.\n\u201cFreeman and slave, patrician\nand plebian. lord and serf, guild\nmaster and journeyman, in a word,\noppressor and oppressed, stood in\nconstant opposition to one another,\ncarried on an uninterrupted, now\nhidden, now open fight, a fight that\neach time ended, either iu a revolu\ntionary reconstitution of society at\nlarge, or in the common ruin of the\ncontending classes.\u201d \"Communist\nManifesto.\u201d)\nThere have always been devia\ntions from this position among So\ncialists. For instance:\nFabian Socialism: this is strictly\na British form of Socialism repre\nsented by the Labour Party. The\nword Fabian represents \u201cgo slow.\"\nft is go-slow Socialism by strictly\nconstitutional means Even when\nthe Labour Party was in power, ti\nlimited its socialization program\n(in Great Britain, called a nation\nalization program) to 20 percent of\nthe nation's economy. The founders\nof Fabian Socialism were Beatrice\nand Sidney Webb. George Bernard\nShaw. H. G. Wells and other intel\nlectuals.\nMarxism: the economic doctrine\nof Karl Marx is based on the\n\u201cTheory of Surplus Value,\" which,\nin effect, means that the increased\nvalue arises only from the labor\ntime added in its production. Har\nold Laski describes this extremely\ncomplicated theory as follows:\n. , It is therefore evident that in\nthe production of any given com\nmodity all who do ngt \u2022contribute\nlabour-power thereto do not pro\nduce values. All. therefore, who re\nceive part of the product without\nthis contribution are parasites rob\nbing labour. Marx accordingly de\nnies that profit results from the\ncapitalist who lends money or the\ntrader who conducts the process of\nexchange. . . \u201d\nAll this theorizing would have\nmeant nothing had not a faction of\nthe Russian Social Democratic Par\nty. the Bolsheviks, succeeded by\nviolence in capturing Russia in\n1917.\nCommunism: generally the cur\nrent Russian system is called\nCommunism, which is an error.\nRussian Marxism is now in what\nthey term a Socialist stage; to b.r\nfollowed by Communism; which\nwill produce a state of society i n\nwhich government withers away.\nThe Russians faced the problem oi\nmaking their ideas work in an an\ntagonistic world. This was accom\nlished by neither Lenin nor Trct\nzky nor anv of the early Bolsheviks,\nbut by a comparatively obscure ad\nventurer. J. V. Stalin.\nIn April 1924. he delivered a ser\nies of lecturers at Sverdlov Univer\nsity under the general title of\n\u201cFoundations of Leninism,\u201d which\nhas become the accepted doctrine\nof Soviet Russia. Soviet China and\nthe satellite states. It is the doctrine\nof every Communist country in the\nworld. It is a practical and flexible\nconcept of \u201c. . . .Ma'xism in the\nepoch of imperialism and of the\nproletarian revolution. . .\nrophyi, but at this writing I\u2019m\ninclined to go along with Emma.\nLeave the grass to the goats.

One of the\nmost sensational aspects of the Mc-\nCarthy investigation was not known\neven to the Senate Eelections Com\nmittee members themselves. It was\nthe sudden flight from the U. S. of\na key witness and friend \u2018of Mc-\nCarthy's - wealthy divorcee Ar\nvilla Bentley.\nMrs. Bentley, formerly married\nto the new GOP congressman from\nMichigan. Alvin Bentley, skipped\nout of the country under the as\nsumed name of Mary Peterson.\nReason for her hurried exit was\nbecause she had officially given\n$7,000 to McCarthy, which is more\nthan the legal limit: in addition\nto which she told friends that she\nand her ex-husband had actually\ngiven around $75,000.\nNaturally, she didn't want to be\ncross-examined by the Senate\nElections Committee.\nMrs. Bentley is a society lady,\nliving next door to Averill Harri\nman on swank Foxhall Road in\nWashington. For a time her hus\nband was in. the State Department.\nFor a time also, both he and Mrs.\nBentley were great friends of Mc-\nCarthy\u2019s. Now divorced, she is still\na friend.\nWhen the Senate Elections Com\nmittee got hold of some of Mrs.\nBentley\u2019s canceled checks, they\ntelephoned her. asked to see her.\nBut .she flew the coop before a\nsubpoena could be served. Board\ning an Eastern Airlines plane at\n1 a. m. Nov. 28. she arrived in\nMiami, transferred to Pan Am\nerican Airlines, and arrived in\nNassau that afternoon.\nMeanwhile. her Washington\nlawyer, Joseph Rafferty, claimed\nhe didn\u2019t know where she was.\nthough actually she was in touch\nwith him and asked him to get\ncertain records of canceled checks\nfrom the Riggs National Bank.\nMis. Bentley was escorted to the\nBahamas by a professional ex-\nCommunist, Harvey Matusow, who\nthen returned to New York, but\nflew back to the Bahamas after\nthe storm had blown over in order\nto pick her up and her back\nto Washington.\nIt was SIO,OOO of Mr. and M;-s.\nBentley\u2019s money given to McCarthy\nthat the Senate Elections Commit\ntee found was carefully withdrawn\nby Jean Kerr, his secretary, then\ndeposited through circuitous chan\nnels in Wisconsin where it was\nused to speculate on soy beans.\nCongressman Bentley, when in\nterviewed by the Senate Elections\nCommittee, emphatically stated that\nhe had not given the money to\nMcCarthy to be used by him per\nsonally.\nSAM RAYBURN FIGHTS\nSam Rayburn, the redoubtable\nTexan who celebrated his 7lst\nCUTIES\n1 M\u00a7 a s I\ni !

Javits\nhas undertaken to define the dif\nference between the Republican\nand Democratic parties and comes\nup with a most interesting state\nj ment of the case:\n\u201c...The Republican Party is\ncommitted to endeavoring to\nrealize the ultimate in human sat\nisfactions of which our economic\nsystem is capable through a com\npetitive and pit.-uie economy with\ngovernment help and co-operation\n\u2014but not domination.\n\u201cThe Democratic Party is drift\ning toward an ever-increasing con\ntrol by government of economic\nas well as political jobs\u2014in order\nto do what it considers a better\nindividual welfare job without\nthe will or the capability toward\nstopping this drift which has very\nattractive short-term political ef\nfects. ..\u201d\nAs for Javits\u2019 definition of the\nRepublican Party, it is sufficient\nly inclusive to represent the views\nof Herbert Hoover, Robert A. Taft\nand Thomas E. Dewey, as it would\nthe so-called liberal Republican\nleaders. As a matter of fact, i/f\nwas the basis for Mr. Hoover's\nprogram when he was president,\nand Senator Taft directed his\nparty in the 80th Congress in\nconformity with it.\nIn a woru, Representative Jav\nits, who calls himself a liberal,\nwhen he sat down to determlhe\nthe nature of his party produced\na concept which the conservatives\nhave generally held to be correct.\nEven in the time of Mark Hanna\nsuch a definition would have held\ntrue. It is within American Tra\ndition.\nRepresentative Javits\u2019 definition\nof the Democratic Party might\nalso be a short statement of the\nposition of Fabian Socialism. And\nthis is now a correct view because\nduring the Roosevelt and Truman\nAdministrations, the drift has\nbeen in the direction of Fabian\nSocialism, starting in the form of\nemergency legislation during the\ndepression and continuing tnfthat\ndirection by war and momeiAfiSfcqj\nJavits. however, opposes the re\nalignment of parties, even cn the\nbasis of his own definitions. He\nseeks a clear-cut mandate from\nthe American people. But Ameri\ncans do not vote that way. No\nelection is a mandate for any*\nthing. Unfortunately, it is a vote\nfor or against an individual.\nRoosevelt was elected because\nmore Americans liked Roosevslt\nthan dislikd him. Truman was\nelected because Dewey was not\npopular enough to defeat him.\nNone of these elections involved j\na mandate, because in none of the\nelections, since 1936, were the is\nsues before the country clearly\nand unmistakably discussed.\n*lf in 1952, the campaign were\non the basis of the Javits defini\ntions, the south generally would\nvote for the Republican defini\ntion under the leadership of such\nDemocrats as Byrnes, Byrd, Rus\nsell, George, and mai-.y others.\nThe views of these leaders fit that\ndefinition p-r'ectly: they do not\nconform tc the drift toward Fa\nbian Socialism.

She sent Fonda to see Connelly, and in fear and trembling,\nhe went to the Gotham Hotel to meet the great man.\nPlaywright Connelly, who\u2019ll admit cheerfully that he\u2019d rather be an\nactor than a writer, suggested that he\u2019d read a few pages of the script,\nto Fonda, \"just to give you the feel of it.\" To the amazement of Fonda.\nConnelly not only read a few pages, he read the entire play. Each time\nMarc would come to a dramatic or humorous point, he\u2019d look meaningly\nat Fonda, who thus cued, would either look tense or bust into applause.\n\u201cYou have a real sense of theatre.\u201d Mare would say approvingly. Con\nnelly took tow hours to read and act out his lines, so he never did hear\nFonda read a single page.\n\u201cYon see Max Gordon tomorrow and he\u2019ll sign you,\u201d said Connelly\n\u201cHow much money do you want?\u201d Fonda, whose salary had ranged\nfrom sls to $35 a week, said he didn\u2019t know what to ask. Connelly\nleaned over to him .confidentially: \u201cAsk him for S2OO a week, and don\u2019t\ntake a cent less.\" So Fonda got his Broadway break by listening to an\nauthor read a play, and the author got him a salary he never would\nhave dared to ask.\n\u25a09l~ Mete.\nby Bob \u25a0 Hop\u00ae\nWanna try for Yellowstone Park?\nI just read about a contestant on a radio quiz show who answered\nthe jackpot question correctly and was awarded an island in Maine.\nI can hear the quiz master telling the winner: \"I\u2019m sorry we have\nto give you this island\u2014But we\u2019re fresh out of refrigerators.\u201d\nNow, the other give-away programs will have to fall in line and\ninstead of awarding newlyweds two glorious weeks at Niagara Falls\nthey\u2019ll give them Niagara Falls.\nAnd since they\u2019ve started giving away land as prizes, even losing\ncontestants may eaoh receive a slice of Texas as a consolation prize.\nIf the trend continues, the government will have to count the\nstates after each program.\nAnd nervous land owners will carefully Inspect their property for\nsigns of termites, boll-weevils and quiz masters.\nBut this new idea in prizes has its dangers.

Sometimes\nordinary mortals like Ralph W.\nButton get tangled up in gobblede-'\ngook, too.\nButton is a leading drygoods\nman of New York and chairman\nof the Retailers\u2019 Emergency Tax\nCommittee. The merchants don\u2019t\nmuch like the $7,000,009,000 boost\nin taxes Congress is talking about.\nThey sent him down to explain\nwhy before the Senate Finance\nCommittee.\nHe was doing fine with the idea\nthat the government probably\nwouldn\u2019t have to hike taxes at all\nif it tried seriously to abolish its\nown fiscal high living. The Fed\nerals shouldn\u2019t expect the taxpayers\nto grin and bear it, he said, so long\nas the government keeps loosening\nits own belt and gobbling up more\nbillions.\n\u201cThese new taxes,\" he continued,\n\u201care regressive.\"\nSen. Robert S. Kerr (D., Okla.)\nwinced. He blinked. He threw up\nhis hands. He almost, but not quite,\nwent, ulp. This seemed to alarm\nSen. Eugene D.

Kerr. He\nturned to Button and asked him if\nhe knew what the word, regressive,\nmeant.\nButton said he believed he did.\n\u201cCan you spell it?\u201d inquired the\nmillionaire Oklahoman.\nButton spelled it out r-e--g-r-e-s-s-i-v-e.\n-g-r-e-s-s-i-v-e. \"I hope that\u2019s\n\u25a0right,\" he said.\n\u201cI hope so. too,\" said the Sen\nator. \"Now tell us what it means.\"\n\u201cWen,\u201d said Button, \"I think it\nmeans going backward.\u201d\n\u201cDo you have your dictionary\nwith you?\u201d Sen.

Too\nmany big words.\nSo I quickly borrowed a diction\nary (Webster\u2019s Collegiate) from the\n.xwggest Senatorial secretary and\nthis is what it said about regressive:\n\u201cReturn of the libido to earlier\nstages of development, or to infan\ntile objects of attachment.\u201d\nIf I were writing a dictionary\nand couldn\u2019t come up with a better\ndefinition than tha, I think I\u2019d\nskip regressive. My guess is that\nit means when folks grow old, they\nlike to think about their childhood.\nWhen they do that, they are re\ngressive.\nBut I can\u2019t be sure. All I do\nknov, lor certain is that Senator\nKerr is right and Button is wrong.\nThe word, regressive, can\u2019t be used\nto describe a tax bill.\nAnd if all this seems like much\nado about nothing, that\u2019s the gen\neral idea.

(International}\n~ ' -\nWEDNESDAY AFTERNOON, JULY 25, 195 i\nLYNN NISBET:\nAround\nCapitol Squahsi\nFREE\u2014\u201cFor the time being at\nleast. North Carolina, to practical\neffect, is getting its rural road\nprogram for nothing.\u201d That is the\nintriguing first sentence in editor\nial analysis of status of road con\nstruction, tax collections and bond\npayments appearing the other day\nin the Shelby Daily Star, publish\ned by Lee Weathers, who as a\nsenator in 1949 was an ardent sup\nporter of the riirql road plan. Edi\ntor Weathers doesn\u2019t suggest that\nthe happy condition of getting\nsomething for ijothlng will con\ntinue; in fact he knows it doesn\u2019t\nactually exist now. On face of book\nkeeping figures the State treasury\nis currently a little bit ahead of\nthe game.\nFACTS\u2014Here are some facts cor\nraled by the Shelby editor in sup\nport of his premise: Because of a\nprice war throughout the Piedmont\nsection of the State, gasoline is sell\ning at retail for less now than pre\nvailing price when toe extra tax\nwas voteu in June of 1949. In areas\nnot affected by the price war the\naverage retail price is very little if\nany higher, despite the additional\none cent a gallon tax. During debate\non the bond issue in toe 1549 as\nsembly it was estimated toe ad\nditional tax would yield from seven\nto seven and a half million dol\nlars a year. Actual yield for the\nfirst six months was $3,932,540, and\nfor the first full fiscal year\u2014July\n1, 1950, through June 30, 1951\u2014the\nyield was $9,508,062. Tentative esti\nmates are that for the current fis\ncal year toe yield will be in excess\nof 10 millions.\nPAYMENTS\u2014The State paid out\nduring the past fiscal year $8319.250\non principal and interest of the\nbond issue. Payments this year and\nnext will approximate 10 millions\nannually, and thereafter the\namount will be about 12 millions\na year until the entire issue is re\ntired. By 1954 all \"old\u201d highway\nbonds will have been paid off and\nthe debt service allocated now de\nvoted to former issues can be trans\nferred to the $200,000,000. That plus\nanticipated yield of the extra one\ncent a gallon tax on gasoline will\neasily carry the load.\nINTEREST Meantime, interest\nis working both ways. The State\nhighway fund is paying out over\nthree million dollars a year in in\nterest on the bonds; but the gen\neral fund is getting back nearly\ntwo millions a year on unexpend\ned portions of the bond .... procsesbr\nand excess tax collet\u2019ions which\nhave been invested in interest bear\ning securities.\nFUTURE\u2014That is such a pretty\npicture, it is a pity to spoil it.\nEverybody knows it cannot last. The\nfirst six words and the last six of\nEditor Weather\u2019s analysis are the\nsame\u2014\u201cfor the time being at least.\"\nWhen all the bond proceeds have\nbeen spent for. new road construc\ntion, and ail the interest payments\nare outgoing and none coming in;\nwhen these new roads require ex\npensive maintenance\u2014as some of\nthem less tluui a year old are re\nquiring now\u2014the story will be dis\nferent. That is why appraisal of the\nreal value of the secondary road\nbond program must wait five or\neight or 10 years.\nCONTRASTING\u2014There are con\ntrasting predictions as to what that\nappraisal will be. There were those\nwho sincerely believed in 1920 that\nthe 50 million dollar primary high\nway bond issue would bankrupt toe\nState as toe roads began to wear\nout before the debt was paid. It is\nalmost unanimously conceded now\nthat the primary highway system\nwas worth progressively more 10\nand 20 and 30 years alter its in\nception than when first designed.\nSome people now sincerely believe\nthat maintaining the secondary\n\"black top\u201d roads will impose an\nimpossible burden on the State dur\ning the next two decades. Others\njust as sincerely believe history will\nessentially repeat, and that in\ncreased business will make easily\npossible not only the maintenance,\nbut considerable expansion, of the\nsecondary system as was the case\nwith the primary highways. Thirty\nyears experience has proven that\nwith respect to public roads the ag\ngregate' cost is of far less import\nance than ability of the people to\npay the bill.\n.COMPLETED Construction,\nmaintenance and improvement of\npublic roads will never be a com\npleted job. The scope of coverage\nand application of State road mon\ney was pretty well completed by\naction of the 1951 General Assem\nbly accepting municipal roads as\npart of State responsibility. Recog\nnition of primary highways, sec\nondary rural roads and municipal\nstreets as vital parts of an inte\ngrated state system of travelways\nassures greater ability and willing\nness of the people to pay the ag\ngregate bill.\nPHILOSOPHY\u2014It might even be\npossible to Justify the claim that\nEARL HAWLEY OIL CO. L\nWholesale Dealer (Sso)\nPROMPT SERVICE - COMPLETE PRODUCTS\nN. Layton Ave. 3794 Phones 2241 Dunn, N. C.\nI-\nNorth Carolinians are getting all\nof their public roads for nothing.\nSuch justification would be based\non the philosophy that if you really\nneed something, you\u2019d just as well \u00a3\nbuy it\u2014because you will pay for it\none way or another whether you\nhave it or not. There is the simple\nlittle story of the man who thought\nhe wasn't able to buy a pair of\nrubber overshoes, caught cold from\nwet feet and lost three days work\n\u2014plus a doctor\u2019s bill. The overshoes\nwouldn\u2019t have \u201ccost\u2019 him a cent;\nin fact, he would have made mon\ney on \u2019em. Direct and indirect pro\nfits from gqpds may mean they\nactually cost nothing. Governor f\nScott is the outstanding champion\nof that philosophy, with one hard\nto-understand exception. He still\ninsists that in getting back a part\nof the money they pay into the\nState highway fund through the\ngasoline tax, residents of incorpor\nated towns and cities are \"robbing\u201d\nthe \u201cpeople.\u201d\n\u25a0 4\nCOMPLETES IBM COURSE\u2014\nSgt.

It is a challenge to us to\nseek further utilization of our\nown natural resources. I do not\nwant to see your electric bills\nfor industrial power go up. I\nwant to see our own bills go\ndown.\u201d\nSenator Kennedy said New\nEngland\u2019s answer to the problem\nof fair competition \u201clies neither\nIn prohibiting Federal power and\nother programs aiding the South,\nnor in cutting wages or social\nbenefits in New England, nor\nmeeting subsidy with more sub\nsidies.\u201d Instead, he called for\npositive action to strengthen the\nminimum wage law. revise the\nTaft-Hartley Law, improve un\nemployment compensation and\nclose tax loopholes.\n.... ;*\u2022 \u2022\nN __ \"'\n\u00ab\u25a0\u00bb,\nThey\u2019re Delicious\nTRfIPPEaS\njoUlfilflHCU\nCuMu\nYAMS\nFilled with Vitamins\nand Minerals, these\ngolden Louisiana\nSweet Potatoes are\npacked in delicious\nsugar syrup.

They show that:\nour party is determined, more than\never before, to carry its message i\nto the voters of this country.\nIt is very signftcant that such\ngreat interest and enthusiasm are\nbeing shown in a congressional!\nelection year. We know that con-1\ngressional elections are as import-j\nant as presidential elections. We|\nfound out in 1946 how much harm;\ncan be done to our country when a j\ncongressional election goes wrong. J\nWe are not going to let that happen;\nagain. We don\u2019t want another do-:\nnothing 80th Congress.\nThese dinners carry forward a I\ngreat tradition. The original Jef-|\nferson-Jackson dinner was held in\nthis city in 1830. 120 years ago. It\nwas given in memory of Thomas\nJefferson, and its guest of honor:\nwas President Jackson. At the first\nJefferson-Jackson Dinner, President\nJackson gave his famous toast\u2014\n\"Our Federal Union, it must be\npreserved!\u201d\nTonight, we meet again to think\nof our Federal Union, to be thank- >\nful that it has been preserved, and\nthat it has grown in strength and\nin service to the people. As in\nJackson's time, we meet to discuss\nsome of the problems that our\ncountry faces.\nWe have some very serious prob-;\nlems today. We are living in a\ntroubled period of the world's his\ntory. Our responsibilities, as a na\ntion, have never been so great, and\nthe decisions we face have never\nbeen more difficult. We confront\nserious questions of foreign policy.\nWe have the problem of maintain\ning an adequate national defense.\nWe have the task of maintaining\nprosperity and protecting our econ\nomy from depression. We have the\nquestion of handling the Nation's\nfinances and the national debt.\nCalled Grave Issues.\nThese are grave issues. And the\nDemocratic Party is meeting them\nsquarely. We do not believe in\ntrifling wifh the people about these\nissues. We do not offer to solve\nthem with vague generalities or\nworn-out slogans. We know that\nthe solution of these problems re\nquires all the wisdom and energy\nwe possess as a nation. We know\nthat their solution requires heavy\nexpenditures. The Democratic Party\ndoes not propose to deceive the\npeople, either about the problems\nwe face or the cost of solving them\nThe Democratic Party has confi\ndence that the United States will\nmeet these great responsibilities. It\nknows that the United States is a\ndynamic, growing nation. We be\nlieve that this country will make\nas much progress in the next 50\nyears as it has made in the last\n50 years.\nBut we cannot meet the responsi\nbilities of today or the challenge\nof the future by following the out\nmoded concepts of 50 years ago.\nThe promise of the 20th century\ncannot be fulfilled by those who\nwould like to return to the days of\nMcKinley.\nWe must go forward with our\nprograms for peace through defense\nand foreign aid. We must proceed\nwith our domestic programs for\nhealth, education, social security,\nand economic stability. Both cur\nforeign programs and our domestic\nprograms are necessary to answer\nthe demands which this critical\nperiod of history makes upon us.\nWe cannot have prosperity at home\nunless we play our full part in the\ndefense and the revival of other\nfree nations. We cannot have peace\nabroad unless we increase the\nstrength, the freedom, and the well\nbeing of our people at home.\nThere are some who would like to\nsee us turn our backs upon the rest\nof the world and drop our efforts\nto strengthen our domestic economy.\nAt the present time, they are\nspreading the mistaken idea that\nwe can save money by going back\nward. They advocate slashing our\nexpenditures for peace and for our\ndomestic programs. These people\nare blind to the problems that\nconfront us. They can see that a\ntax cut would help their own pock\netbooks temporarily. They fail to\nsee that, in the long run, false\neconomy would endanger, not only\ntheir pocketbooks, but their lives\nand the continuation of civilization\nitself.\nIt is true that our present ex\npenditures are large. But the Dem\nocratic Administration is working\ntoward a balance in the Federal\nbudget. I wish we could balance the\nbudget immediately by the simple\nexpedient of cutting expenses. But\nthat is out of the question. More\nthan 70 per cent of our Federal\nbudget goes to pay for past wars\nand to work for peace in the future.\nAny one who says that these ex\npenditures are less than one third\nof the budget\u2014and less in propor\ntion to the national income than\nthey were 10 years ago.\nTo Cut Expenditures.\nI would like to cut expenditures\nfurther, and I intend to do so at\nevery opportunity. But I do not pro\npose to weaken the strength and\nsecurity of this country. 1 do not\npropose to place the peace of the\nworld in jeopardy to satisfy the\nadvocates of false economy.\nIn this difficult world situation,\nsome people are talking about gen\neral tax reductions. I regard this as\npolitical hypocrisy. We had one\nrecent experience with an ill-timed,\nirresponsible tax cut. Much of our\npresent financial difficulty is the\nresult of the sweeping tax reduction\nwhich was enacted in 1948 over my\nveto\u2014at a time when expenditures\nfor defense and foreign policy were\ninevitably rising. We must not make\nthe same mistake again.\nIn this election year, the Demo\ncratic Party will not play politics\nwith the Federal budget. We will\nstate the honest truth about the\nbudget, just as we will about all\nother issues. We believe that the\npeople are entitled to the plain facts\nabout every issue, so that they can\nmake up their own minds.\nThe Democratic Party can afford\nto be frank and truthful, because it\nis working for the general welfare\nof all our citizens. It does not serve\nany narrow group or clique. This\nmakes it easy for the Democratic\nParty to put its program before the\ncountry openly and completely. We\nhave nothing to hide from the\npeople. Our strength lies in explain\ning our program and our policies to\nthe people. And the more thor\noughly we explain to them what the\nDemocratic Party is trying to do,\nthe more certain we can be of their\ncontinued support.\nThere are many differences be\ntween the Democratic and the Re\npublican Parties. But I think the\ngreatest difference is that the Demo\ncratic Party is the party of af\nfirmative action\u2014it is for measures\nto achieve prosperity and progress.\nThe Republican Party is the party\nof negative inaction\u2014it is always\nagainst things.\nThe principal thing that Re\npublicans are against, of course, is\nthe Democratic Party. But they\ncan\u2019t win on that plank alone. They\nmust try to find reasons for being\nagainst the Democratic Party. They\nmust persuade people to vote against\nthe Democratic Party. And that is\ngetting harder and harder to do.\nOne reason it is hard to do is that\nthe Republican Party has no af\nfirmative program of its own. It\nrefuses to take thought and make\nplans for the future. Instead of\npresenting a positive program of\ntheir own, the Republicans sit\naround waiting for us to make, a\nproposal. Then they react with an\noutburst of scare words. They are\nlike a cuttlefish that squirts out a\nblack ink whenever its slumber is\ndisturbed.\nmint for New Scare Words.\nRight now, the main problem ofi\nthe Republican leaders seems to be\nto find some new scare words. They\nhave not had much luck along that:\nline, lately. They tried using the i\nphrase \"welfare state\u201d as a scare\nword for a while, but they discovered\nthat the people are in favor of a\ngovernment that promotes their\nwelfare. So they dropped that scare\nword. Then they tried \"statism.\u201d\nBut my good friend, Gov. Lehman,\ntook care of that one in the New\nYork election\u2014so they had to drop\nit, too.\nNow, the Republican leaders have\nhad to go back to an old standby.\nFrankly, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as good\nas some of the others, but it ap\npears to be the best they can think\nof. Their current scare word is\n\u201csocialism.\u201d\nIt\u2019s perfectly safe to be against\n\u201csocialism.\u201d The difficult thing is\nto make the country believe that\nthe Democratic Party stands for\nsocialism. How in the world can\nthe Republicans persuade people\nthat all you Democrats at all these\ndinners are Socialists?\nIt can\u2019t be done. But the Re\npublicans will try it just tl>e same.\nThat\u2019s what they've been trying to\ndo ever since 1933. For the last 17\nyears they have called every new\nDemocratic measure \u201csocialism\" or\n\u201ccommunism,\u201d and they have made\nconstant predictions of doom and\ndisaster. The plans and proposals\nthat we have advanced for improv\ning the condition of the people of\nthis country have been greeted with\nthese same old scare tactics during\nall these years.\nAnd I\u2019m going to prove that to\nyou.\nLet us take it step by step.\nIn 1933, this country faced some\nof the greatest problems in its his\ntory\u2014the \u2022 problems of providing\nfood and work for millions of job\nless persons and their families, or\nsaving millions of farms and homes\nfrom foreclosure, of restoring a\nbanking system that had collapsed,\nof placing the entire economy on\nthe way to recovery.\nThe Democratic Party rolled up\nits sleeves and went to work. It took\nsteps to provide relief and jobs, to\nsave farms and homes, to restore\nbanks and business. Bit by bit the\neconomy responded to those vigorous\nmeasures. Income began to grow,\nconfidence returned, business activ\nity mounted. This was the response\nof the economy to our farm and la\nbor business programs\u2014our pro\ngrams for resource development\nand public works and the oullding\nof homes.\nAs this miracle of recovery un\nfolded. what was the attitude of the\nRepublican Party?\nIn 1934, the Republican National\nCommittee issued a policy statement.\nAnd in that statement they said:\n\u201cAmerican institutions and Ameri\ncan civilization are tn greater\ndanger today than at any time since\nthe foundation of the Republic.\u201d\nThat sort of talk may have\nfrightened the members of the\nUnion League Club. But it didn't\nfrighten the peijple who had been\nsaved by the New Deal from bread\nlines and bankruptcy.\n\u201cAmerica in Peril.\u201d\nIn 1936, the Republicans thought\nthe danger was worse. In that year,\nthe Republican platform cried out:\n'America is in peril. The welfare\nof American men and women and\nthe future of our youth are at stake\n* * * the New Deal Administration\u201d\n\u2014this is from the 1936 Republican\nplatform\u2014\u201chas bred fear and hesita\ntion in commerce and industry, thus\ndiscouraging new enterprises, pre\nventing employment, and prolonging\nthe depression.\u201d\nPeople weren't scared by that one\neither. They knew it just didn't\nmake sense, because the national\nincome had risen more than 50 per\ncent in the previous four years, and\nit was still rising.\nIn 1940, the Republicans tried to\nscare us again. This time their\nplatform said:\n\"The Administration has imposed;\nupon us a regime of regimentation\nwhich has deprived the individual\nof his freedom and has made of\nAmerica a shackled giant. . . . The\nNew Deal Administration has failed\nAmerica.\u201d\nThat's what the Republicans said,\nbut the America that the New Deal\nhad saved\u2014the economy that the j\nNew Deal had freed and made pro\nductive again\u2014became the arsenal\nof democracy that overwhelmed the\nforces of totalitarian aggression.\nBut that still didn't teach the\nRepublicans anything. In 1944, when\nwe stood at the peak of our wartime\nproduction\u2014the economic bulwark\nof the free world\u2014the Republican\nParty platform proclaimed: \u201cThe\nfact remains that, under the New\nDeal, American economic life is1\nbeing destroyed.\u201d That\u2019s what they;\nsaid in 1944\u2014\"American economic\nlife is being destroyed.\u201d\nApparently, they never learn any\nthing. Today, when we have a na\ntional output of over $250 billion a\nyear and a higher standard of living\nthan ever before, the Republican\nParty still cannot see anything good\nabout the situation. In their policy\nstatement issued 10 days ago, the\nRepublican National Committee de\nclared: \u201cThe major domestic issue\ntoday is liberty against socialism:\n. . . . basic American principles\u201d\u2014\nthey said\u2014\u201care threatened by the\nAdministration\u2019s program. . . .\u201d\nIt\u2019s the same old story\u2014the same\nold words and music\u2014the same\nempty and futile attempt to scare\nthe American people\u2014in complete\ncontradiction of the plain facts that\nare visible to every citizen in his\ndaily life.\nsame Outcry in 17 Years.\nFor the past 17 years, the same\noutcry has greeted every proposal\nadvanced by the Democratic Party\n\u2014whether it was for better housing,\nsocial security, rural electrification,\nfarm price supports, minimum wages\nor any other program for the general\nwelfare.\nIn 1944, Representative Joseph W.\nMartin, jr., summarized the Re\npublican attitude toward all these\nprogressive steps in one brief para\ngraph when he said:\n\"For 11 years we have been stead\nily drifting into a regimented Nation,\nwith absolute control vested in a\nADVERTISEMENT.\nALAN\nWhen the time comes for Uncle\nSam to say, \"Put a little some\nthing in the\npot, boy.\" he\nmeans put it\nin. That\u2019s\nwhy more\nauditors are\ngoing to be\nused to check\nmore income\ntax returns\nthis year\nWhile most\nincome tax mistakes are acci\ndental as slipping on a bar of\nsoap, one out of every three re\nturns examined last year still\nowed some folding money to\nUncle Sugar. This year the in\nternal revenue bloodhoufids are\ngoing to watch things even\ncloser. They expect us to take\nall legal deductions and exemp\ntions . . . but they don\u2019t ex\npect us to ad lib.

Unless there\nis a change in Government this\nyear\u2019\u2019\u2014that was in 1944\u2014\"we can be\nreconciled to some kind of totali\ntarian, socialist government.\u201d\nThat is what the Republicans said\nabout our programs in 1944. That\nis the way they talked about them\nin 1948. That is what they are say\ning about them now.\nToday, we are proposing further\ndevelopment of our resources,\nfurther strengthening of our econ\nomy, new measures for the welfare\nof the people. And what do we\nhear? The same old story. It is all\nrepeated in that latest statement of\nthe Republican National Committee:\n\u201cThis program\u2019\u2019\u2014they said, and\nthey were talking about the pro\ngram of the Democratic Party\u2014\n\u201cthis program is dictated by a small\nbut powerful group of persons who\nbelieve in socialism, who have no\nconcept of the true foundation of\nAmerican progress, and whose pro\nposals are wholly out of accord with\nthe true interests and real wishes of\nthe workers, farmers and business\n! men.\u201d\nWell, let\u2019s look at the record.\nWhat is our program? Where It\nit come from? Our program is the\nplatform adopted by the Demo\ncratic Party in its convention of\n1948. And it has been voted on by\nthe people of this country, includ\ning the workers, farmers and busi\nnessmen.\nIf our program was dictated, as\nthe Republicans say, it was dic\ntated at the polls in November.\n1948. It was dictated by a \u201csmall\nbut powerful group\u201d of 24 million\nvoters.\nAnd I think they knew more than\nthe Republican National Committee\nabout the real wishes of the work\ners, farmers and businessmen.\nOf course, this program is not\nsocialism. It is based upon a firm\nfaith in the strength of free enter\nprise. It is designed to strengthen\nthe markets of free enterprise and\nto expand the investments of free\nenterprise. It will make our citizens\neconomically secure, well educated,\nand confident of the future. Only in\na nation of such citizens can free\nenterprise grow and expand and\nreach its full possibilities.\nAimed to Promote Welfare.\n1 The program of the Democratic\nParty is aimed to promote the pros\nperity and welfare of the American\npeopie. It is aimed to increase the\nfreedom of the American people.\nFreedom is not an abstraction.\nFreedom is a reality in our daily\nlives. The programs of our party\n| have freed workers from economic\nsubjection to their employers. They\nhave freed farmers from the fear\nof bankruptcy. They have released\nfarm wives from the bondage of\nceasless drudgery. They have freed\nolder people from the fear of a\ndependent old age.\nOur programs look forward to the\nday when our people will be freed\nfrom the fear of inadequate medical\ncare and crushing medical expenses.\nThey are aimed at freeing our\nyoung people from ignorance and\npoor education. And on these foun\ndations for greater freedom for all\njour people, we are going forward\ni to break down the barriers to eco\nInomic opportunity and political lib\nI erty that have been created by\nI prejudice and discrimination.\nThis is the record and the prom\nj ise of the Democratic Party in ex\nj panding the freedom of the Ameri\ncan people. And when the Repub\nlican Party proclaims that we are\nj engaged in restricting freedom\u2014\nthat we are the enemies of freedom\nI\u2014I ask, \u201cWhose freedom?\u201d Let the\nj American people look into their own\n'lives and ask themselves whethei\nj they enjoy greater freedom or less\nthan they did 18 years ago.\nAbout the only freedom we have\nlimited is the freedom of Republi\ncans to run the country. Maybe\nthat is what they are complaining\nabout.\nFor the Republicans to drag out\nthe same old moth-eaten scare-crow\nof \"socialism\u201d again in 1950\u2014after\nhaving used it, or something very\nlike it, in opposition to every\nprogressive step the Nation has\ntaken since 1933\u2014is an insult to the\nintelligence of the American people.\nOut of the great progress of this\ncountry, out of our great advances\nin achieving a better life for all, out\nof our rise\" to world leadership, the\nRepublican leaders have learned\nnothing. Confronted by the great\nrecord of this country, and the\ntremendous promise of its future, all\nthey do is to croak\u2014\u201csocialism!\u201d\nTo Advance in Freedom.\nThe Democratic Party is going\nright ahead to meet the needs and\ncarry out the aspirations of the\nAmerican people.\nOur objective is to advance in\nfreedom\u2014to create a system of\nsociety that is ever more responsive\nto the needs of the people\u2014to estab\nlish democratic principles so firmly\nin the hearts of the people that they\ncan never be uprooted.\nIn the present anxieties and\ntroubles of the world, the real\nstrength of our country lies, not in\nthe arms and weapons, important as\nthey may be, but in the freedom of\nour citizens and their faith in a\ndemocratic society. Among the na\ntions of the world, we stand as an\nexample of what free men can do\nwhen they are in control of their\nown affairs and dedicated to the\nconcept of a better life for all.\nTo w'ork for the prosperity, the\nwelfare, and the freedom of the\nAmerican people is to work for the\nvindication of democratic institu\ntions everywhere. And it is only\nthrough the growth of democratic\ninstitutions that a just and lasting\npeace can finally be achieved.\nIn this troubled world, it is more\nthan ever important tha't the\nDemocratic Party remain steadfast\nin its devotions to those ideals. It\nis more than ever important this\nyear that the Democratic Party\npresent its program to tne people\nso plainly that it cannot be mis\nunderstood. If we do that,. I am\nconfident that the people will again\nvoice their aproval of the principles\nwhich lead to increased prosperity,\nwelfare, and freedom\u2014not only for\nthis country, but for free nations\neverywhere.\nAuditors Live Long\nPUNXSUTAWNEY.

CHAS.\nDECORATING STANDING COMMITTEE\nWho is financing Sen. Joseph McCarthy\u2019s (R., Wis.)\nsmear campaign\nThat\u2019s a fair question. It\u2019s always important to know\nwho pays the bills.\nBut will McCarthy tell who is paying for his smear? He\nwill not. On May 17 The New York Times reported:\n\u201cSenator Joseph R. McCarthy, Republican of Wisconsin,\nsaid today that he had been getting \u2018quite a bit\u2019 of financial\nhelp during the last two or three weeks for his onq-man in\nvestigation of Communists in high places in the Government.\nHe declined, however, to disclose the sources of the dona\ntions.\n\u2018I would just as soon not go into that at all,\u2019 he said in\nresponse to a reporter\u2019s inquiry.\n\u201cThe discussion was started by a reporter who remind\ned Mr. McCarthy he had said in a recent radio address that\nhis campaign had practically bankrupted him. The Senator\nindicated, though not precisely, that the money began to\npour in after that disclosure, when the public learned that\nCongress had not voted any money for his private investi\ngation.\n\u201cThe Wisconsin Senator continued in his refusal to dis\ncuss what he called \u2018the intimate details,\u2019 saying merely that\n\u2018we are getting along all right.\u2019\nThere is only one possible conclusion that can be drawn\nfrom those statements:\nMcCarthy does not want the public to know who is foot\ning the bills for his politically-inspired smear campaign\nagainst the State Department.\ni .Why don\u2019t you want the people to know who your fin\nancial angels are, Senator? Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s important\nfor the people to know who is behind you?\nWhat are you trying to hide, Senator McCarthy?\nHistory Repeats Itself\n\u201cThere were predictions last year that a minimum wage\nof 75 cents an hour would put such a strain on some busi\nnesses\nthat workers would lose jobs and businessmen would\nlose their investment.\n\u201cSo far the Wage-Hour division of the Labor Depart\nment has no such report.\u201d\nSo reported the Associated Press last week.\nIt\u2019s a familiar story: Whenever action is proposed to\nhelp th\u00a7 workingman\u2014or the farmer, or the small business\nman, of the public generally\u2014there\u2019s always a crowd of\nlittle, frightened men who get a case of hysterics and scream\nthat the country is headed for Hades in a hand basket.\nAnd their shrill predictions of doom always get knocked\ncockeyed. That\u2019s been true since the days when their an\ncestors said public education would turn America into a So\ncialist stale right down to this minute when they damn every\nprogressive piece of legislation with a \u201cjMilice-state\u201d label.\nEmployers said a 75-cent minimum wage would force\nsome of them to close up shop or lay off workers. The Labor\nDepartment reports there have been few lay-offs artd no\njump in prices of products which low-paid workers turn out.\nThe law now has been in effect for more than four\nmonths. It covers only low-paid workers\u2014such as those who\ntoiled for as little as 40 cents an hour in high-profit tobacco\nfactories\u2014who are \u201cdirectly\u201d engaged in turning out goods\nthat move in interstate commerce.\nIncidentally, retail store employes in Ohio, Indiana, Mis\nsouri, Colorado and Wisconsin never should forget that Sen\nators Taft, Capehart, Donnell, Millikin and Wiley voted to\ntake them out from under the protection of the 75-cent mini\nmum wage law.\nThose gentlemen figured $30 a week is too much to pay\nyou, regardless of how much profits your store owner might\nmake.\n'Contribution To Common Welfare'\nOur very preoccu|\u00bbation with the rights and welfare of\nwage earners should clear us of the charge that we are ready\nto sacrifice the good of the whole for the advantage of a bloc.\nNot only do the wage earners represent almost half our pop\nulation, but they are overwhelmingly the consumers of the\ncountry. Their well-being or ill-being is directly reflected in\nnational prosperity or depression.\nTo argue that service in behalf of the wage earners of\nAmerica is a form of special pleading is to lose sight of all\nthat laljor means to our democracy. It is to assume that what\nis good for lalior is bad for industry, when just the reverse\nis true. It is to assume that lalior and management are un\navoidably set against one another, when the truth is that\nthey are but separate fingers of the same hand, striving for\neffective performance.\n1 repudiate the doctrine of an irrepressible conflict be\ntween workers and employers. In promoting the cause of the\nwage earner the Department of Labor is making a contribu\ntion to the common welfare. Those who think that the De\npartment of Ijibor is somehow working against the common\nwell-being, because of its commitment to the American wage\nearners, must also believe that you can\u2019t be faithful to your\nwife without being disloyal to your country, or devoted to\nyour mother without being hostile to the other mothers of\nthe land.\nThe solution to most problems will be overheard if you\nlisten to the next three men that you observe in conversation.\nW.

ROSE STEWART\nWho's Paying McCarthy?\nWeak Rent Control Bill In Prospect\nAs Deadline Approaches P1W\nYou\u2019re probably going to get only a little bit of rent con\ntrol in the next year. Here\u2019s what Congress is expected to\ndo about it:\nA bill which continues Federal controls through Dec. 31,\n.1950, stand a good chance of enactment. The controls could\nbe left on until June 30,1951, only if the voters in the cities\nwhere there still is rent control approved the extension.\nThe House Banking and Currency Committee okayed\nsuch a measure. Chairman Brent Spence (D., Ky.) says\nCongressional sentiment indicates \u201cthis is the best we can\nget.\u201d The House may act on the bill this week.\nThe Senate Banking and Currency Committee has held\nhearings on rent control, but has not acted on the question.\nThe rent law expires June 30.\nShortcomings of the House bill are obvious. In many\ncities it\u2019s difficult to get a special election\u2014such as would be\nneeded to continue controls through June 30,1951. Also, it\u2019s\neasy for the real estate lobby to confuse people in such elec\ntions. Finally, few people vote in special elections.\nIn short, Congress is knuckling under to real estate\nlobby pressure.\nWhat can you do about it A letter to your Congress\nman or Senators\u2014explaining what the end of controls would\ndo to your rents\u2014would help.\nBusinessmen Always Scream 'Socialism'\nWhen Public Gets Aid\nRep. William Green, Jr. (D., Pa.) points out that busi\nnessmen always have shouted \u201csocialism\u201d when legislation\nin the public interest has been proposed.\nIn a speech May 8 at the annual convention of the Penn\nsylvania Federation of Labor in Philadelphia, Green says:\n\u201cThey cried \u2018socialism\u2019 when we wrote the Social Se\ncurity Act. They cried \u2018socialism\u2019 when we wrote the Wag\nner Labor Relations Act. They cried \u2018socialism\u2019 when wages\nand hours standards were set. They cried \u2018socialism\u2019 when\nthe security exchanges were regulated. They cried \u2018social\nism\u2019 when decent housing became a matter of Government\ninterest.\n\u201cAnd without benefit of a crystal ball we can predict\nthat the old familiar bird call will ring out when they discuss\nthe welfare state next fall.\n\u201cThey will still yell \u2018socialism\u2019 in spite of the steady\nearnings and dividends and the backlog of orders in business.\nThey are still in charge of their businesses and Government\nimposes regulations only when it is in the public interest.\nAnd that is a duty of Government.\u201d\nPension Demands Not New\nThe very big business leaders who are today shouting\nthe loudest about a \u201cwelfare state\u201d are themselves eligible\nto receive retirements and pensions from the corporations\nwhich employ them. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that: it is\nall to the good. It is progress and common sense. But, it\nsimply points the way to pensions and other benefits for\nthose who toil for there corporations. And why not?\nFinally, American Labor is well aware of the fact that\nall of these things cost money. Most pension and welfare\nplans are in lieu of wages, the money to finance them coming\nright out of the workers\u2019 pockets. In some cases the Unions\nthemselves have such plans, financed by substantially high\ndues structures.\nWhat so many of those who are in positions of influence\neither fail or refuse to recognize is the fact that American\nLabor knows and discusses the cost factors in all pension and\nwelfare plans and is fully cognizant of the position of indus\ntry. Nothing is free, but the air we breathe. We must pay\nfor all benefits, and benefits which may bankrupt even a\nsmall section of industry are too dangerous to consider.\nKnowing the facts produces light and it is more light\nwe need, not more heat.\nEvent\nWhen the editor and publisher of a newspaper uses his\neditorial columns in behalf of trade unions and higher wages,\nit is an event well worth noting.\nThat is exactly what J. G. Coughlin, editor and publish\ner of the \u201cNews\u201d in West Memphis, Ark., recently did.\n\u201cWe are not well versed in the tenets of unionism,\u201d he\nwrote, \u201cbut we do know that unions help get wages up for\nall working people\u2014organized and unorganized.\n\u201cWho wants a business in a town full of people .who\ndon\u2019t have money to spend? That\u2019s the only thing wrong\nwith business in this locality right now\u2014sub-standard pur\nchasing power. When wages go up, our business is bound to\nbenefit.\n\u201cThink that over, some of you businessmen who make\nyour living selling merchandise to customers who are trying\nto raise families on less than $50 a week.\u201d\nThis editorial should be required reading for Arkansas\u2019\nSenator J. William Fulbright who opiiosed the bill raising\nthe minimum wage from 40 to 75 cents an hour.\nAFL On Guard\nNo slave labor products will be used at the new United\nNations headquarters in New York if the American Federa\ntion of Labor can help it. The AFL, always the uncompro\nmising opponent of human slavery in any form, is keeping a\nwatchful eye on the award of contracts by the UN.\nBoth Soviet Russia, which has slave labor camps con\ntaining literally millions of persons and Communist-dominat\ned Czechoslovakian have indicated they are interested in sell\ning furnishings and other equipment to the UN for use in\nthe new world capital buildings.\nThe AFL has repeatedly urged a thorough investigation\nof the terrible slave labor conditions known to exist in Rus\nsia. Satisfactory action on the American labor\u2019s proposal has\nnot yet been taken by the United Nations. In the interest of\nfreedom and justice, the AFL intends to press hard for a\nsearching proble of slavery wherever it exists.\nWelfare State As An Ideal\nWhat is this \u201cwelfare state\u201d that the conservatives are\nalways criticizing? Sen. Herbert Lehman (1)., N. Y.) says:\n\u201cTo my mind the welfare state is simply a state in\nwhich people are free to develop their individual capacities,\nto receive just rewards for their talents and to engage in the\npursuit of happiness, unburdened by fear of actual hunger,\nactual homelessness or by oppression by reason of nice,\ncreed or color.\u201d\nAnother Taftism\nSenator Taft wants to lop off $600 million from funds\nto help war-torn Western European countries recover their\neconomic health.\nBut he wants the United States to lend Franco Spain\n$50 million.\nWhy?\nTHE POTTERS HERALD, EAST LIVERPOOL, OHIO\njSMi. i-rAM.-i \"'A\nThe Reconstruction\nJ. v\u2019*\nr':\"\nI\nBEHIND THE HEADLINES\u2014\nThe AMA high command still considers national health insurance\na top campaign issue. A lot of that $3,000,000 propaganda fund that\nthe publicity firm of Whitaker & Baxter is spending this year for\nAMA will be paid to newspaper publishers this fall. It hasn\u2019t been\npublicized vet, but when the election fights begin to get hot, watch\nfor big AMA ads in every daily and weekly in the country. Prepared\nby the AMA\u2019s publicity experts, they will be sizzling attacks on can\ndidates who support health insurance.\nThe doctors are going in wholeheartedly for political activities to\nblock national health insuranc^. Dr. John J. Masterson, president of\nthe Medical Society of the bTate of New York, opened the society\u2019s\nannual meeting by reminding his colleagues that the medical pro\nfession is second \u201conly to the clergy in its potential power to formu\nlate public opinion.\u201d He asked for political action in each state as\nsembly district against \u201cthe creeping threat of socialism.\u201d And his\nsuccessor as president, Dr. Carlton E. Wertz, made a speech described\nin these words by Earl Ubell of tree conservative New York Herald\nTribune: \u201cDr. Wertz. went farther than the labor-union concept of\npolitical action committees and suggested that the doctors join mem\nbers of allied professions to work and vote for favorable candidates.\nThere are 22J1Z6 doctors in the Statp Medical Society.\u201d\nThe doctors\u2019 threats of political death to supporters of national\nhealth insurance aren\u2019t scaring couragous members of Congress. In\nfact, Sen. Herbert Lehman, New York Democrat who has bitterly\nfought by the state\u2019s doctors although he expressed opposition to na\ntional health insurance in the special election last fall, is talking\nstronger words to the doctors than ate many of the Senators who don\u2019t\nface re-election fights in November.\nHe told the doctors and hospital administrators of the Greater\nNew York Hospital Association on May 13 that the \u201ccentral problem\u201d\nof health care is that \u201cof every-day medical care for the great bulk\nof our population\u2014for the great mass of people who are neither weal\nthy nor indigent. These latter two classes are the only ones to whbm\nall necessary medical care is now available.\u201d Sen. Lehman went on to\nstate that plans like Blue Cross and Blue Shield are \u201cnot the final\nanswer. Most hospital insurance plans provide only limited service.\nMost medical insurance plans are likewise limited and cover only a\nsmall portion of the population. Finally, there are ^considerable areas\nin the nation where medical pre-payment plans are impractical and\nwhere even hospital insurance does not reach. For these reasons and\nothers, I am convinced that the public interest demands further gov\nernment participation in the national health effort. I think that such\na development is inevitable. I hope that it will take place in an intel\nligent manner, in a constructive maaner, and in a cooperative manner,\nwith wisdom and with understanding. This is as much up to you as it\nis up to government.\u201d\n\u2014In New York, the Chrysler Corp., whose executives predicted\nthat if strikes continue capitalism will perish, acted as though it flour-*\nished on strikes. The United Auto Workers went back to work after\n1 0 days on strike, and on the same day Chrysler announced a quarter\nly dividend of $1.60, compand to $1.25 in previous quarters.\n\u2014In Caracas, Venezuela, while the Venezuelan president was in\nthe US getting honorary college degrees a* a great democrat and\nfriend of labor, the government dissolved 45 oil workers* unions.\n\u2014In Uniontown. Pa., union miners had the last laugh at indus\ntrialist G. Carl Arerord who made a speech early in 1949 ridiculing\nJohn L. Lewis for owning.a building in Washington heated with fuel\noil. Last week Arcford converted his own coal furnace to gas\u2014al\nthough he owns four coal mines ih southwestern Pennsylvania and\nW^t Virginia.\nK--Tn Minneapolis, there was an echo of the fight waged by the\nAl4L Hotel di Restaurant Employees union against the hiring,of girl\nbartenders in New York. Members of Local 9, AFL City A County\nEmployes Union, voted unanimously against the employment of la(jy\nelevator operators in the new Minneapolis County Welfare Building.\n\u2014In Indianapolis, President Dan Tobin, of (d\u00bbe AFL Teamsters,\nlai! the groundwork for a feud with the AFL Tobacco Workers Union\nthat could rock the foundations of the AFL executive council.

Quite the contrary. The AMA is in politics to keep things as\nthey are, especially the way American families pay for medical treat\nment. But whether their political action will pay off is another matter.\nDoctors think it\u2019s a question of dollars and cents. AMA members,\npersuaded by AMA propaganda, are convinced that national health in\nsurance would mean less income for them and less freedom. Yet, if\nthey would look at the issue squarely, they would find that national\nhealth insurance actually would be a boon to the conscientious doctor\nwho is repeatedly frustrated by the dollar barrier between him and\nthose desperately needing his knowledge and skill. -Certainly, there\nare plenty of wage earners who weuld find the plan a boon to them,\nand who have no desire to cut their doctors\u2019 incomes.\nThat\u2019s why Dr. Elmer L. Henderson president-elect of the Am\nerican Medical Association was wrong again when he announced tri\numphantly last winter that \u201cthe Democratic high command apparent\nly is bowing to the public\u2019s reaction ^gainst any proposal for a com\npulsory health insurance program. Administration forces appar\nently have discovered that compulsory health insurance is not a very\npopular campaign issue in the 1960 Congressional elections.\u201d\nWe think that, at best, Dr. Henderson is deluding himself about\nthe present and future success of his AMA\u2019s $3,000,000 campaign\nagainst national health insurance. So, we\u2019d like to call to the doctor\u2019s\nattention these cold, hard facts. Political facts.\nDespite the AMA claim, the Democratic party still considers na\ntional health insurance a top campaign issue.\nAt its Chicago meeting on May 16, the party\u2019s national resolutions\ncommittee declared. \u201cIn order to avoid socialized medicine in the US,\nwe, endorse the President\u2019s program for broadened federal activity in\nthe entire field of health and medical care and tha adoption of a pay\nas-you-go insurance program to put better medical care within the\n.financial reach of all Americans.\u201d\nMoreover, the Republicans still consider\u2019Yiatifltfhl health infta/\nance a top campaign issue. Thomas E. Dewey, twice its presidential\nstandard-bearer, on May 18 dedicated a new $4,000,000 research lab\noratory for Sterling Drug Co. His whole speech was a demagogic at\ntack on health insurance. Here\u2019s a sample: \u201cBy whatever name you\ncall it, you don\u2019t make this political:bait smell any sweeter,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIf Washington ever did get control (medical care) nobody would ever\nknow whether the federal wholesale purchase of drugs for the masses\nof our people was determined by doctors or by the five percenters.\u201d\nWASHINGTON LABOR\nE\nO\nby BRADFORD V* CARTER L\u00bbA\nThursday, June 1,1960\n\u2014In Philadelphia, the 164th Annual Methodist Conference gave\nserious consideration to a proposal \u201cto send missionaries to the or\nfjanized labor movement.\u201d The next day a group of AFL and CIO\neaders proposed sending missionaries to the Methodist Conference\nafter debate disclosed that the Conference was paying $2600 a year\nto full pastors and $2300 to probationers.\n\u2014In London, England, for the first time in history a trade union\nwill operate an aircraft carrier. The 16,000-ton battle-scarred Cam\npania will be turned into an open-air cafe for the Festival of Britain\nin 1951 and will be run by unionists.\n\u2014In Tel Aviv, Israel, the world\u2019s youngest full republic turned\nup the newest kind of strike when 300 doctors called a 24-hour \u201cun\navailability\u201d because the government refused, to give their union of\nficial recognition.\n\u2014In Chicago, officials of Actor\u2019s Equity went through the union\nconstitution, by-laws and code of ethics trying to figure out how to\nhandle charges brought by Carole Borgia, 23-year old adagio dancer,\nagainst her dancing partner. Miss Borgia complained that during\nrehearsal the partner nit her in the face with a six-foot bull snake.\n\u2014In Washington, the NLRB put an end to a new \u201cwear\u2019em out\u201d\ntechnique devised by employers who want to stall off contract nego\ntiations- for weeks and months. The NLRB ruled that an employer\ncannot insist that the union offer contract after contract until he finds\none he likes.\n\u2014In New York City, Gov. Tom Dewey addressed the AFL Typo\ngraphical Union and announced he had once been in the newspaper\npublishing business. \u201cThis is the only trade in which I have a right\nto a union card,\u201d he said, \u201cand it is one that I don't have.\u201d A few\nminutes later every man in his audience could have told him why he\ndid not have a right to the card when Dewey confessed, \u201cI wrote the\neditorials and then went out and set them in print myself.\u201d\n\u2014In Washington, D.

The milk man told\nunion leaders that the horse couldn\u2019t stand seeing his oWn face on the\nsurface of the polished trunk and took a bite at it.\n\u2014In Kingstown, Eire, it was proved that there are labor-hating\nbosses on the other side of the Atlantic, too. The owner of Downey\u2019s\nBar in Kingstown threw a big party to celebrate the 11th anniversary\nof the strike of his barmen. He invited the entire town in for free\ndrinks just to see them pass through the 11-year-old picket line.\n\u2014In Washington, D. C., reactionary Rep. Ralph Gwinn (R, N.

Once their\nown walkout has started, the next thing they do is call a strike at all\nthe banks. With the banks closed down all the other workers figure\nthere\u2019s no use working if they can\u2019t get paid, so they walk out in sym\npathy with the original strikers.\n\u2014In New York City, the publication, \u201cPublic Relations News,\u201d\ngave a distinguished accomplishment award to General Electric \u201cfor\napplying the principles of human relations in dealing with employes\nand their unions.\u201d The award followed by exactly two weeks a state\nment by General Electric\u2019s vice-president in charge of labor relations\nthat \u201cNo union on a national scale is any good.\u201d\n\u2014In Louisville, Ky., the Kentucky Federation of Labor reported\nthat something new in picketing appeared on the streets during the\nweek of the Kentucky Derby.

After they had been in Siberia more than a year they\nlearned they were not\u2014as they thought\u2014Army officers, but civilian\npersonnal, despite the fact that they dressed like officersj carried side\narms, and commanded troops. Ever since then, the railroaders have\nbeen pressuring Congress, not for pensions or veterans\u2019 benefits, but\nfor a principle. They want honorable discharges from th6 Army which\nthe US military says they were never in.\n\u2014In Reno, Nevada, a cleaning firm brought in a bunch of scab\nwindow cleaners from Los Angeles. There was no picketing, no one\nuttered a single threat, but one by one the scabs packed up and Went\nback to Los Angeles. The police just didn\u2019t seem to be interested in\ncatching whoever was using a B-B gun to pepper the behinds of the\nscabs as they sat on window sills doing their scrubbing.\n'Free Enterprise',\n'Competition' And\nThe Automatic Co.\nThe lords *of industry, when they are not wailing about \u201ccreeping\nsocialism\u201d, or \u201clabor monopoly\u201d or the \u201cunbridled power of labor\nbosses\u201d, moan about \u201cgovernment interference in business\u201d. At all\ntheir conventions they posture that all they want is a chance for free\ncompetition.\nBut the government keeps coming along with anti-trust suits, and\nthe Federal Trade Commission keeps issuing complaints, showing that\nthe very last thing thi big boys want is free enterprise and free com\npetition that they resort to all sorts of skullduggery to stifle com\npetition.\nThe latest example is the complaint issued by the FTC against the\nAutomatic Voting Machine Corp, of Jamestown, N. Y. Now, a com\nplaint is merely a charge, but the FTC makes no charges, and issues\nno complaints, without thorough investigation. And its charges\nagainst the Automatic Corp, make very interesting reading, for the\nAutomatic sells 90 per cent of all the voting machines used in this\ncountry. Its only competitor provides the other 10 per cent. Shouldn\u2019t\nAutomatic be happy, and let the other guy alone? Well, according to\nthe FTC, Automatic is pulling a lot of neat stunts to take that other\n10 per cent of the business away, too.\nAutomatic and its officers ^nd certain employes, tell prospective\ncustomers, according to the FTC, that the competitor\u2019s product makes\nfraud possible, because the voting machine can be manipulated that\nthe competitor\u2019s machine won\u2019t last more than five to six, years that 1\nthe motor in the competitor\u2019s machine is inefficient that the com\npetitor\u2019s financial stability is questionable, and its manufactuj^ngi\nselling and servicing experience is inadequate. i!\nHow true are these statements of the Automatic? The FTC says\nthat engineers and government officials have studied both types of\nvoting njachines, looked into the other charges made by Automatic,\nand that the charges have no basis in fact.\nBut that isn\u2019t all that Automatic has done, according to FTC.\nWhen some misguided community, despite all the propaganda, has\ndecided to buy the competitor\u2019s machines, Automatic has instigated\nand financed \u201cvexatious and groundless law suits\u201d against purchasers\nor prospective puycljftser^ and these suits haye included taxpayers\u2019\nsuits.\nAnd no matter where such suits have been filed, said the FTC, \u2019g\n\u201cthey have generally followed a similars pattern.\u201d Thus, whether it\nwas a taxpayer in Bangor, Maine, or Tucson, Arizona, who apparently\nfiled such a suit, the charges, by a not-so-strange coincidence, have\nalways been similar.\nSuch suits, says the FTC, are groundless, and brought in bad\nfaith.\n\u201cDisparaging, false, misleading and deceptive\u201d, is what the FTC\nsays about Automatic\u2019s. going-on, and the result is to suppress com\npetition and create a complete monopoly.\nNow the boast of the big boys in business is that they love no\nthing better than good, clean competition, and may the best product\nwin, and competition is healthy, and the people benefit in the long\nrun, because competition means lower prices.\nWell, the FTC says that other companies are preparing to get into\nthe voting machine business, but that the practices of the Automatic\nCorp, \u201cthreaten the existence of all potential competition.\u201d\nBVC is ready to present an ancient fur-lined antimacassar to the\nfirst official of the National Association of Manufacturers who can\ntake this story and prove that it only goes to show big business just\nloves free competition. e"}, {"title": "catholic times.", "city": ["Columbus"], "date": "19560817", "raw_text": "\u25a0IB\n4\u2014THE CATHOLIC TIMES Friday, Aug. 17,1956\nThe Washington Letter\nWASHINGTON Sometimes\nwhen Congress adjourns one\nwonders why anyone ever runs\nfor the Senate or House of Rep\nresentatives, particularly the\nlatter.\nEvery time the gavel falls\nfor the last time, the great\nmajority of our legislators\nleave Washington and scurry\nhome.

According to Mr. I^w\nrence, the real issue in this\nsession of the Congress was\nstate socialism versus private\nenterprise.

But unless\nhe is privy to secret informa\ntion which has completely es\ncaped our own attention and\nthat of our associates in the\nCatholic social action move\nment, we can only conclude\nthat he has permitted his fear\nof socialism to become an ob\nsession. He says, for example,\nthat there was a sizable bloc\nof legislators in the last Con\ngress that was anxious to push\ngovernment ownership on every\nside. He seems to suggest that\nthis bloc of alleged socialists\nincluded the majority of the\nmembers of one party and a\nminority of the other. \u201cThey\nwill not be happy,\u201d he says\nprofession, he may have to\nstart all over.\nWhy do men, and women, run\nthis risk? Different persons\nwould have different reasons.\nPerhaps the most logical ex\nplanation is that a Senator or\nRepresentative has great pres\ntige and power. He is one of a\ngroup of only 531 men and\nwomen who legislate for their\n160,000,000 fellow citizens.\nThere is an unmistakable glam\nor about Capitol Hill, too. And,\nhaving once experienced it, it\nis hard to settle for anything\nelse.\nAnd Washington the city\ntakes a hold on one. Many ex\nSenators and ex-Representa\ntives remain here and practice\nlaw, or take up some other oc\ncupation.\nEven at that, a politician who\nfalls from favor in this country\nis much better off than one who\nloses out in a Red-dominated\ncountry.

An expression like \u201cthe\nCatholic vote,\u201d called by a prominent Catholic\nwriter \u201ca mirage,\u201d is tossed about loosely but\nwith such seeming authority that unsuspecting\nreaders could easily be duped into believing\nthat it actually exists.\nPerhaps here it would be of interest to note\nthat, in a valid poll taken among Protestant\nministers across the nation, 70 per cent were\nshofn to be of the opinion that priests in\nfluence the vote among the Catholic citizenry.\nThough there may be isolated cases in which\npriests do exercise some influence of this kind\nover groups, such cases would be so utterly\nrare as to be insignificant.\nOn the other hand there are issues on which\nthere ought of moral necessity be a Catholic\nvote. Thus it would be correct in these cases to\nspeak not only of thinking with the Church but\neven voting with the Church. Laws that would\nin themselves bring moral harm to a community\nor a state ought to be opposed with one mind.\nIf there be any real concept of \u201cthe Catholic\nvote,\u201d this is it.\nlegislation, for example, that would deprive\nindividuals of God-given rights simply because\nof their color or creed would rightfully be oppos\ned by a Christian vote or Catholic, if you\nwill.

But the Ca\ntholic\u2019s philosophy of life ought to be so unmis\ntakable as fairly to shout out, \u201cBy this shall men\nknow that I am a Catholic, that I love my fellow\nman.\u201d\nA Catholic college professor once answered\ne question put to him what is your philosophy\nof life? with this: \u201cI believe in God, the\nFather almighty, the Creator of heaven and\nearth, and Jesus Christ, His only Son, Our\nLord .\u201d This, he said, was his philosophy of\nlife.

It is a book, of course, which tells How, and is done by\nan aging psychologist after years of university lecturing and plat\nform work, has now settled to one form of attack he will \u201cwrite\nmore articles and books to help people understand themselves\nand each other.\u201d\n\u201cGet What You Want out of Life.\u201d It may be asked whether\nmany persons even know what they want out of life. In general,\nto be sure, people want ease and plenty. But this want is usually\nunformulated and unspecified it surges unqestioned in folks as\nthe tide moves in the sea. Sane human natnre is made for peace\nand happiness, and can\u2019t help wanting these blessings. Man\u2019s\nnatural appetite is for God and heaven. It is only when the\ndistortion left in mankind by sin, and the efforts made by\nmyopic science, turn men\u2019s minds to specific material purposes\nthat people begin to have notions about \u201cwhat they want out\nof life.\u201d\nMan, the prodigal, is meant to use the hardships inevitable\nin the calmest life to make him turn away from futilities and\nstruggle to reach his Father\u2019s house. But the world, with its\npsychologists and its sociologists and its advertising men and\nits \u201chow to .\u201d books, is continually badgering the prodigal\nto tarry and consider the merits of really superior husks. \u201cNever\nmind about going Home,\u201d they say, \u201cstay here and live modern-,\nrelax get the most out of life travel collect annuities enjoy\nelectronic gadgets have fun make friends and influence peo\nple get degrees manage corporations blow a horn put anti\nsmell on yourself oil your hair drink beer borrow money\nmeet the press Get Things Done increase your personal effic\niency answer the $64,000 question.\u201d\nThus .is prodigal man exhorted to forget the bread of his\nFather\u2019s table, and to fill himself with slops meant for the\nswine-trough. Man is urged to forget to consider what he is for,\nand to set his mind and heart upon what he wants, or rather\non what he thinks will give him what he wants. The catechism\nsays, \u201cKnow, love, and serve God.\u201d The Modern Book ($3.50\nat your bookseller\u2019s) says \u201cConsider the Miracle of Modern\nEfficiency.\u201d\nThis new book which tells you how to \u201cget what you want\nout of life\u201d has some alluring suggestions to stay the poor\nprodigal and to divert him from his effort to get Home. For\ninstance, it proposes no less than three tested ways of \u201cwork\ning without getting tired.\u201d An arresting thought, surely. Then\nit suggests a method of \u201cincreasing your memory,\u201d a sure-fire\nattraction to ail, even to the fellow who has little to remember.\nPerhaps the most interesting promise of this new book\nis its pledge to teach you how to solve problems while you sleep.\nWe begin to catch some notion now of what is meant by working\nwithout getting tired. If a man may lie down to quiet dreams\nand arise refreshed with his problems solved, he has caught\nthe secret of effortless achievement and untiring toil. There are\nindeed some things one can do while asleep. Recall the British\nM.P. who said, \u201cI fell asleep and dreamed I was making a\nspeech in Parliament. I woke up, and, by golly, I was!\u201d\nBy making a speech while asleep is something much less\nthan solving problems in sleep. A man faced by the problem\nof increasing his salary, or the problem of meeting pressing\npayments on car or TV set, or the problem of satisfying an un\nreasonable employer, is not likely to leap up in answer to the\nalarm-clock, smilingly aware of the right answers. But this\nbook, at $3.50, will tell him how the thing is done.\nThe book has One Essential Rule for gaining people\u2019s confi\ndence quickly. The operative word in that sentence seems to\nthe word quickly. This is indeed a promise most precious to the\nperson who has phony stocks for sale, or who is under pres\nsure and must make a rapid touch. After all, there are situa\ntions in life which preclude the possibility of a few hours\u2019 rest\nful sleep during which the toughest problems may be solved\nproblems have a way of presenting themselves with demand\nfor immediate solution. It is often necessary to gain people\u2019s\nconfidence quickly, particularly when the people concerned are\nsuspicious to begin with, and loud and demanding in their atti\ntude. To know that One Essential is surely worth more than\nthe price of the book.\nThe book has other promises. It will teach you to increase\nyour will power (five ways to do it) it will tell you how to cut\nyour mistakes in half (again, five methods) it will enable\nyou to read twice as fast (the comparison is not completed\nprobably means twice as fast as a three year old child) it will\nturn your thoughts into results it will empower you to put your\nemotions to work. In a word, the book presents, with a show\nof scientific gadgetry, what the Rosicrucians promise with a sug\ngestion of mystagogy. Be ever at your best. Release that inner\npower. Be a Big Wheel be a World Beater. Only don\u2019t go Home,\nprodigal, don't go Home!\nOne last note. The book presents no less than 24 guaranteed\nways of staying sane. It is important that a fellow who solve*\nproblems in sleep, and who has cut his mistakes to a minimum,\nand who gains people\u2019s confidence quickly, and who has increas\ned his will power by five tested methods, and who reads with\ncommendable rapidity, and who remembers like anything\u2014\nit is important, we say, that such a chap keep clear of the looney\nbin.

But what they tell the public and what\nthey tell (privately, to utility company heads\nare two different things, And, inside the\nfamily, they admit they have manufactured\n1 the \u201csocialism\u201d issue deliberately.

It seems\nthat surveys show overwhelming support for\nthe Tennessee Valley Authority, and for ex\ntending that idea tp other regions like the\nMissouri and Columbia river valleys. Worse\nstill, for the utilities, is what kind of people\nz ,think so highly of TV A and extending the pro\ngram. The survey showed tremendous support\n/by teachers and editors by Republicans by\npeople who believe in \u201cfree enterprise.\u201d The\nsurvey shows 65 per cent of the people in\nthe upper income bracket approve of TV A.\nNow, the private utilities want no part of\n\u2018the government public power program. When\nthey fought the TVA, they said TVA would\nruin them.*\u2019 (They are making more money\nthan ever.) When they fought the Rural Elec\ntrification program, they cried it would ruin\nthem. (They have made more money in the\nrural areas than ever.) What\u2019s eating them\nis that the government has been showing up\nthe outrageous rates they have been charg\ning, and where the government has stepped\nin, the consumers get a break because rates\ngo down.\nSo, since the public generally favors TVA\nand expansion of the idea, the utilities have\nto attack from another quarter.

Douglas\npointed out, said the purpose of the confedera\ntion was \u201cfor their common defense, the se\ncurity of their liberties and their mutual and\ngeneral welfare.\u201d\nThe Constitution of the United States, he\npointed out, says it in the preamble that among\nthe five fundamental purposes in forming the\n\u201cmore perfect union was \u201cto promote the\ngeneral welfare.\u201d The first paragraph of Sec\ntion 8, Article 1, of the Constiution itself says\n\u201cThe Congress shall have power to lay and\ncollect taxes, duties, imposts and excised to\npay the debts .and provide for the common\ndefense and general welfare of the United\nStates.\u201d In other words, Congress is given\nspecific power to levy taxes in such a way as\nto provide not only for the \u201ccommon defense\u201d\nbut also the general welfare.\u201d\n.' More, as the debates in the Congress on\nadoption of the Constitution showed, the in\ntent of the language finally adopted was to\ngive Congress the power to spend for the\ngeneral welfare.\n\u201cThe welfare concept,\u201d declared Douglas,\n\u201cis in the forefront as an equal partner of\njustice, domestic tranquillity, defense and\nliberty. And in the first clause of Article T,\nSection 8, there is provided and effective way\nof promoting this general welfare, namely, to\nspend for it.\u201d\nDouglas pointed out the doctrine was\nstated by Mason, Jefferson and Madison, and\nrestated by Lincoln when he said government\nwas not only \u201cof\u201d and \u201cby\u201d the people but\nalso \u201cfor\u201d the people affirmed later by\nJustice Hughes, Brandeis, Cardozo, and Stone,\nDouglas added:\n\u201cBehind and beneath them, it has sprung\nfrom tiie well-springs of the American people\nthemselves For with all their proper em\nphasis upon individualism and self-reliance,\nthe American people have always known that\nthere are some burdens too heavy to be borne\nalone and some evils which can only be re\nmoved by collective action. To help bear these\nburdens and to help remove these evils, it is\nproper for the government, as one of the\nagencies for collective betterment, to act.\n\u201cBecause the state has .concerned itself\nwith the troubles and difficulties of average\npeople who have little property and low in\ncomes, it has helped to win and retain their\nloyalty arid devotion to the democratic prin\nciples, which, though under attack in most of\nthe world, stand firm in America. They stand\nfirm here because they are rooted in the hearts\nof the people who see in government, not an\ninstrument of oppression, or an icy institution\nindifferent to their needs, but an agency which\nis carrying into effect at least some of the\nprinciples of* human brotherhood.\u201d\nWhether the American Congress will ac\ncept such a plan is, for the moment, beside the\npoint. As a matter of\nexpected of Congress\nReuther was drafting\nSenators were trying\nPlan \u201cbecause of the world situation,\u201d a con\ntradiction that defies explanation. The Senate\nAppropriations committee, under prodding\nfrom the White House, was voting to restore\nthe cut it had made in Point Four funds, but\nthe Point Four timidly engineered by Con\ngress was a far cry from what men of vision\nhad hoped it might be. Perhaps Reuther would\nat least succeed in injecting a little vision into\nCongressional thinking by stirring up contro\nversey. The anticipated reactions of the Tafts\nand Byrds might actually make others mad\nenough to ponder Reuther\u2019s proposal.\n\u2018'''J*\nBill\nthe\ncold fact, little can be\nalong this line. While\nhis 100-year program,\nto slash the Marshall\nWhile Reuther was speaking out, Sen. Taft\nwas writing condescendingly about \u201cwar with\na few Korean Communists.\u201d Nevertheless, Taft\nseized the opportunity to say that the expense\nof Korea would make it necessary to cut do\nmestic government expenditures, \u201cparticularly\nthose which require the purchase of materials\nand the use of labor.\u201d Taft anticipates a steel\nshortage and he may be right. Reuther, in an\nnouncing his 100-year plan, specifically\ncharges that \u201cthe owners of the steel industry\u201d\nare \u201cwedded to a program of planned eco\nnomic scarcity with low volume and high\nprices.\u201d He calls for expanded steelmaking\ncapacity. He also says that if \u201cidle, govern\nment-built war plants\u201d were put into opera\ntion we could produce civilian or military\ngoods in any amount required. Taft undoubt\nedly would object. \u201cSocialism,\u201d he\u2019s cry.\nBut Taft would be wise to heed Reuther\nbefore lie cries too loudly. Many liberal econo\nmists are of the opinion that how we distri\nbute the production of military and civilian\ngoods in our total national productive plant\nmay in the end be more important than man\npower or wage controls. In an economy opera\nting virtually at full blast, as ours is these\ndays, the problem is less one of putting people\nto work than of determining what they can\nproduce. z\nFpll blast or not, however, Reuther points\nout that 3% million Americans are unem\nployed an dthat another 2 million are work\ning part-time but are available for full-time\njobs. The UAW president says that 3 million\nmore jobs, in the idle war-built plants, pre\nsumably, would produce the $13 billion a year\nhis plan would require. If the world crisis\nworsens, we may create those extra jobs\u2014r\nlater on. We could do it now with a clear ob\njective in view. But that\u2019s an imaginative ap\nproach that might strain the collective mind\nof a Congressional majority.\ntunic*\nV j*\nV $*?\nTOLEDO UNION JOURNAL\nCIO Offers To Aid\nProbe Of Anti-Labor\nAdministration Of T-H\nWASHINGTON (LPA) If\nthe Senate sub-committee on La\nbor Management Relations will\nlook into the \"\"anti-labor and\ndiscriminatory fashion in which\nth\u00a3 Taft-Hartley Act has been\nadministered,\u201d the CIO will be\nglad to help.

But you mustn\u2019t\nthink of the $25,000 as a contribution. Perish\nthe thought! It\u2019s a credit against the purchase\nof \u201ceducational\u201d literature.\nThat\u2019s why Edward A. Rtunley, executive\nhead of the CCG, refused to tell the House\nSelect Committee on Lobbying Activities the\nnames of his chief financial supporters when\nhe testified a couple of months ago. The CCG\nwas a publishing house, Rumely said. His big\nbackers made no contributions, he insisted,\nthey just purchased books. To release their\nnames and the amount of their purchases\nwould be to reveal \u201ctrade secrets.\u201d However,\nby something more than coincidence, all the\nliterature attacks the Fair Deal, the New Deal,\nlabor unions or the British Labor Party.\nJust how the system works shown by\ncorrespondence between the CCG and Eli\nLilly & Co. of Indianapolis, manufacturers of\npharmaceuticals.

In that statement was expressed very\nclearly the basic philosophy of free enter\nprise that has made America the power it is\ntoday.\nA member of the National Retail Dry\nGoods Association recently pointed out in this\nconnection that one of the jobs of retailers\nis to emphasize the merits of the American\n* free enterprise system to the people because\nretail stores represent the closest contact\nmillions of people have with American busi\nLast year, for example, the nation spent\n$127,000,000,000 for goods and services \u2014 and\n$96,000,000,000 of that amount was spent in\n9 stores of one kind or another. We turn to the\nretailer for our needs as naturally as we turn\nto a faucet for water.\nAmerican retailing in all branches is a\nperfect example of the competitive system at\nwork. Every kind of merchant is trying to at\ntract trade in new ways \u2014 by offering lower\nprices, better quality, larger stocks and/or\n\u00ae improved services.\nRetailing\u2019s contribution to American liv\ning standards is tremenduous. In no other\ncountry are consumers in small towns offered\nthe same kind of goods at the same prices as\nconsumers in great cities. This too, is a result\nof competition.\nDespite all these advantages, however,\n# there are elements in this country seeking to\nundermine our system. There are those, who,\nunder the guise of liberalism are seeking, not\noutright Communism, but a slower poison\nknown as socialism which, in its final stages,\nis not much different.\nAnd when socialism gets into the saddle,\nit is almost impossible to unseat it.\nThe Portland Oregonian, in a recent issue,\ncommented on that statement in the follow\nmanner:\n\u201cIn a democratic country such as the\nUnited States, private ownership is al\nways on the uneasy seat. Election after\nelection can be ordered on the same issue\n\u2014say on government ownership of pow\ner. Private ownership may win over\nwhelmingly today, yet tomorrow it faces\nthe effort all over again. But public own\nership if it wins just once is for practical\npurposes secure . . . The victory of capi\ntalism in any election is tentative; the\nvictory of socialism is virtually fianl.\u201d\nWhy is it final? It is final because it,\nhaving once attained the power of govern\nment, has charge of the public monies; it can\ndominate elections through the patronage\nsystem and that of bureaucracy; it becomes\na mass employer\u2014and the livelihood of mil\nlions is dependent on its perpetuation.\nThen, in the words of one writer in the\nIndustrial Review: \u201c ... If the American peo\nple learn only one fact from history, it should\nbe this; the preservation of all liberties can\nonly be insured in a social and political sys\ntem in which the government regulates but\nnever competes, and in which the state is\nnever permitted to become a mass employer.\u201d\nIn attempting to evade Communism,, let\u2019s\nnot back into the buzz-saw of Socialism.\nIT'S THE LITTLE THINGS...\nBy A. UTTLEMAN\nHow long has it been since you\nreally took in a storm? I mean\u2014\ndropped everything, relaxed your\nmind, and went out by the barn\nor sat on the well curb to watcn\nthe majestic performance of a\nlate afternoon thunderstorm.\nI did this afternoon (the wife\nthought I was plowing the gar\nden). The clouds were not spec\ntacular in themselves, but you can\nnever tell a cloud's personality by\nits size, contour, or color. But\nthey rolled across the northwest\nafter milking time, bouncing their\nbombs against the fields and the\nwoods across the river and fill\ning Deep Creek Valley around\nme with prolonged sound. The\nsound that rolled and roared\nas it rolled, always started high\nin the heavens and beat swiftly\ndownward to clap against the ho\nrizon.\nThe display of fireworks, though\ndistant, dwarfed any man-made\nattempts that I ever saw at a\ncounty fair. Sometimes there would\nbt only a great flash of light\nwhich silhouetted all the nearer\nclouds in vivid outline, the whole\npanorama becoming for an in\nstant like a modernistic paint\ning on a golden canvas. Again\nthere would come forked tongues\nof liquid flame, licking in split\n\u25a0second rapidity the storm's venom\nagainst the earth. Those flashes\nleft their imprint across my vi\nsion and I could still see the\nstreaks seconds after they were\ngone. Then again there would be\nshort spurts of light that made\nme wonder if the fuse on that\none was faulty.\nThere's something about watch\na storm that gives one a sense\nof the nearness of God. The\nthunder, the lightning, the tow\nering thunderheads are entirely\nworks of Him. Man with all of\nhis great advance into the scien\ntific mysteries of the universe\nhas not defaced nor added to the\nthunderstorm. It is just like it\nwas when you and I were boys\nhoping for enough rain to give\nus a holiday; it is just like it\nwas when Abraham gazed out\ntrom his tent to watch it give\ngreener grazing for his flock; it\nij just like it will be, I venture\nto say, when Gabriel begins his\nfinal practice session.\nToday there are not many things\nthat remain as stable as does the\nthunderstorm. That is why,, when\nI've hear the thunder begin to\nroll across the fields and woods\nt<- us on a summer's day, we feel\na faint nostalgia welling up in\nour chests.\nI find I have emotions that\nonly the thunderstorm can sat\nisfy. And there are but few emo\ntions that may be satisfied with\nso little expenditure in time or\nmoney. To find a place where\nno one will disturb you and\nwhere there is a clear vision\nacross fields or water is all you\nneed to do. Once you have at\ntained the necessary relationship\nyou will have something that can\nnot be taken from you.\nAnd finally, if you have found\nyour faith in God wavering, and\nif you are coming to believe that\nthe world is no longer the place\nyour mother was a part of, you\nmay find strength in a storm;\nfor it is an ageless evidence of\nthe stability of the universe and\nforever a majestic testimony that\nGod is there, if we will but look\nfor Him.\nMethodist Church\nCircles W ill Meet\nThe circles of the Woman\u2019s So\nciety of Christian Service will\nmeet at the Rosemary Methodist\nChurch Monday evening at 7:30.\nMrs. Viola H.

Pacific Gas\nmrd Electric has disclosed that tt is going to put up the\nhugest power plant in California.\n\u00a3 There is little doubt that the U. S. business man re\ngards the long range' outlook for business as very good\nturd, consequently, every week business men are an\nubuming plant expansions that will cost hundreds of mil\nlion dollars. Yet while business men seem to be confident\nlElthe long range outlook for\u2019business, their speeches in\nflate that they also feet that this country is on its way to\nhell.\nFrom California, Theodore Petersen, president of\nStandard Oil Company of California, states: \u201cThis great\nIndustrial system is in grave danger of being literally tink\nered and bossed and r .\u2018. dated to death.\u201d The President\nAmerican Bankers Association, James E. Shelton,\nhas this to say: \u201cIt is startling to see. . . how far we have\ntraveled down the toad toward State Socialism.\u201d\n* The head of the Manufacturers Association of Con\nnecticut, Alfred Bodine, who, incidentally, is also presi\ndent of a machine tool company in Bridgeport, in reflect\ning on the trend toward socialism, has this to say: \u201cThe\n\u00a3ruth is that we already have Socialism in America, not\nComplete as yet, but .\u2018at advanced.\u201d\n\u201e It is unquestionably true that the topic uppermost\namong top businessmer today is the drift toward social\nism. Yet it is difficult to reconcile this pessimism on the\nAmerican future with the faith the business man appar\nently has in America's future by his plans frtr expansion\nnot to be completed until 1953, \u201964 or \u201955.\nFortune Magazine indicates that a possible explana\ntion is that the U. S. business man is a pious hypocrite,\nthat he is making plenty of money and expects to go on\nmaking mftney. He just wishes the government would let\nhim keep more of it.\nWe do not believe that the average U. S. business\nman is a hypocrite. We certainly do not feel that he is in\nsincere in his alarm over Socialism. We are inclined to\nbelieve that the U.

I C^r\nBy British Expert\nHousewife Called Vital to\nDefense Food Plan\nThe average housewife is the]\nbackbone of any emergency feed-:\ning program, Miss Edith Walker,'\n|one of England's top experts oni\n'emergency feeding, said yesterday.\nMiss Walker, director of emer\ngency feeding for the British Min\nistry of Food, is here at the invi\ni tation of the Federal Civil Defense\nAdministration. She will confer!\nWith civil defense, public health\nand nutrition experts in 13 cities\nin the United States, and with\ncivil-defense authorities in Can\nada.\nDuring the last war, the British\nlearned the use of improvised!\ncookers made of bomb rubble.!\nmud and old iron, she said. On j\nthis sort of stove, you can cook\njust as many meals as on a regu\nlar one. Britain\u2019s women are be\ning trained again to make and use\nthis stove, a practical program\nthat has captured the interest of\nhomemakers.\n\u201cEnglish housewives don\u2019t want\nto think about war,\u201d Miss Walker\npointed out. \u201cBut they will re\nspond to a program if they can see\na practical need.\u201d\nThey are applying other lessons\nof the last war, too, she said. One\nis that emergency feeding must\nbe treated strictly as an emergency\nmeasure, with a return to normal\nas soon as possible.\nThey learned, too, that food\nimmediately available is vital in\ncivil defense.\n\u201cWe stockpiled coffins,\u201d Miss\nWalker said, \u201cbut we hadn\u2019t even\n. decided which department was\nresponsible for feeding when the\nemergency came.\u201d If you're civil\nized. she went on, something hot\nto drink and a snack after such\nan experience helps you regain\nyour equilibrium.\nAfter a raid, they feel, the first\nneed is for something easily pre\npared, easily swallowed; and\nfamiliar, such as hot soup or a\ndrink and a snack. After that,\nheavier food, such as a stew, is\nin order.\nThe British have developed a\nspecial enriched powdered soup\nifor emergency feeding.\nMrs. Ellen C. Ruthman, Miss\nWalker\u2019s American counterpart,\nsaid that a program involving\nimprovised fireplaces and cookers\nis being started here, and is one\nof the things in which there is\n:most widespread interest. Al\nthough the British use wood and\ncoke, waste oil and water have\nbeen suggested as effective for\nthis purpose in the United States.\nTo Talk on Spain\nMrs. Rosario Granadas Cooper\nwill give a talk in Spanish on \u201cThe\nCharm of Spain\u201d before the Club,\nde las Americas at 8 o\u2019clock to\nnight in the Department of Com\nmerce Building at Fourteenth and\nE streets N.W. Mrs. Cooper, who\nis descended from an old Seville\nfamily, visited Spain last summer,\nand will illustrate her talk with\ncolor slides which she took on the\ntrip.\nMembership Tea \u00bb\nA membership dessert tea will\nbe held by the Women\u2019s Associa\ntion of Allied Beverage Industries\njnext Wednesday at 12:30 p.m. in\n| the home of Mrs. Sarah Eisenberg,\n5520 Thirty-third street N.W.\nMrs. Mary Kessler, membership\nchairman, is in charge of ar\nrangements.\nRecipe\nNotebook\nCrown Roast of Pork\nA crown roast of pork makes an\nelegant dish for a dinner party.\nAnd if there are leftovers, the\nroast may be cut into chops and\nthese reheated with gravy in a\ncasserole.\nAsk the butcher to make you up\na crown of 12 pork chops. Season\nthe meat with salt and pepper\nand put in a roasting pan with\nthe bone ends up. Wrap the\nbones with salt pork or bacon to\nkeep them from scorching and\nspoiling the appearance of the!\nroast. i\nFill the center with any fa-;\nvorite stuffihg\u2014one with sage is\nusually good with pork. Roast\nuncovered at about 350 degrees for\n1 30 minutes to the pound.\nBefore serving, remove the fat\nfrom the ends of the bones. Put\npaper frills over them, and gar\nnish with cinnamon apples and\nparsley.\nAn Easy Dessert\nThat Wins Praise\nA lovely young lady of our ac\nquaintance who has made a name\nfor herself as a hostess who serves\ndelectable food, told me of this\nvery unusual and delicious dessert.\nShe takes white seedless grapes,\nwashes them well, and then dries\nthem thoroughly. This is impor\ntant. Then she puts them in a\ndish and covers them with pro\ncessed sour cream and sets them\nto get very cold. Just before serv\ning she sprinkles them with brown\nsugar, and passes more brown\nsugar for the guests to help them\nselves.\nWith this she serves a very light\nbut pungent spice cake, warm from\nthe oven.\nPresident of Federation\nWarns Against Socialism\nMrs. Oscar A. Ahlgren, presi\ndent of the General Federation of\nWomen's Clubs, warned against a\n\u201cdrift into socialism\u201d in an address\nyesterday before the Woman\u2019s\nClub of Chevy Cha^e.\n\u201cThose who suggest that an all-,\npowerful Federal Government own\nand operate our steel mills, rail\nroads, medical professions and\nother businesses and services are\njust closing their eyes to.the con\nsequences,\u201d Mrs. Ahlgren asserted.\n\u201cUnlike communism, socialism\nmoves slowly and it can take over!\na nation without the people being\niconscious of what is happening.\u201d:\n; The speaker said the \u201caver- j\nage American\u201d is the \u201cmost dan-'\nigerous person in the United\nStates today,\u201d explaining: \u201cCom-:\nplacency, prosperity and con-:\ntentment all. combine to prevent!\nthe so-called average American:\nfrom accepting the fact that we:\nare drifting into socialism.\u201d\nMrs. Ahlgren spoke at the club\u2019s j\nmonthly meeting and luncheon i\nheld at the group\u2019s clubhouse, i\nShe called on the clubwomen\nto join her in a campaign of\nAmericanism directed against so\ncialism, communism, government\nwaste, corruption and lethargy.\n\"Although times may be chang\ning, the fundamental precepts\nupon which this great land of\nours was founded are just as\nvalid today as they ever were,\u201d\nshe declared. \u201cWe must be dedi\ncated to freedom above all else,\n!for then, and only then, will we\nkeep our republic.\u201d\nI A number of Maryland club\nleaders attended the session at\nwhich Mrs. James G.

But most of our growth\nhas been substantial and permanent.\nAs one of the oldest merchants of the city (maybe\nijotin age, but in experience) I have made a lot of ob\nservations about our town.\nOne of them is\u2014and it applies everywhere else as well\n&7\u00a3h Dunn\u2014that we can accomplish much by sticking to\ngether and working together. Working at odds brings\nabout nothing but chaos and dissension, stalemale and\ndecay.'\n\u00bb I have observed also during these past 29 years that\npractically all the town's real growth and progress took\npTtice during those periods when the town has had an\nactive and aggressive Chamber of Commerce.\nThere have, of course, been brief periods of prosperity\naaad boom. But those permanent things\u2014those lasting im\nptovenjents we still have with us\u2014came about under the\nChamber of Commerce and through its efforts.\n\u2018\u201c\u2019\u201cIt\" was my proud and happy privilege to have had a\npart in the formation of a Chamber of Commerce here\non- two occasions. One chamber didn\u2019t last long; I think\n{t\u2019s safe to say the Chamber of Commerce is here to stay.\nA came from a town in Alabama that had a Chamber\nOs Commerce and I had served there as head of the organ\nization. When I came to Dunn I saw the need for a Cham\nbef. here. I don\u2019t claim credit for organization of Dunn\u2019s\nChamber, but I did plenty of hollering about it.\n*\" \" - Because I have had a part in the chamber\u2019s oper\nailpns' here, I have had an opportunity to see the great\namount of hard work which local citizens have put into\ntbe' ofganization.\n\u201d lean recall those days when we were fighting for\nsuhew-modern hotel, tobacco mailcat, a hog market, more\ntgnrist business, more industries hnd the other things\nevery town needs. We have some m those things now.\nWe don\u2019t have all of the things we need\u2014such as\nmore smokestacks, more payrolls, more industries of all\ntypes, and particularly more home industries.\n\u2022 All of us keep wishing and waiting for a big multi\nmillion dollar industry to come to town. That would indeed\nbe wonderful. But we can just sit by and wait idly. There\nare\" a lot of horhe industries we could cultivate.\n; . For instance, we spend many thousands of dolla' s\nevery year buying Heinz, Campbell, Del Monte and other\ncanned goods, shipped in here from distant points. We\nproduce all those raw products here. We ought not to\nhave to buy the processed goods back at a premium price.\n; T have been thinking particularly of the great poss\nibilities of the dairy industry. What a wonderful thing\nit;hyould be if we could form an organization and pro\nvide smaall farmers throughout the country with two or\nthree cows apiece. Those cows would give these small farm\ners a good, year-round extra income, and it would also\nSave importing so much milk from out of the section and\nput of the State.\nWe are proud of those heme industries already here\n\u25a0j\u2014such as Wellons Candy Company, Johnson\u2019s Fertilizer\nCompany, McKay Manufacturing Co., Lynch Manufactur\ning Company, the G. and W. Poultry Co., the Black River\nMattress Company\u2014to name a few\u2014and all the others.\n' The possibilities here are almost endless. You who\nare reading this no doubt have some better ideas than\nthose I have listed.\nThe thing about it is that we must have a central or\nganization to carry out these ideas, to plan and then\nglgmote and bring the ideas into realities. And, it is\nneedless to point out, a certain amount of money is re\nquired for operation of the Chamber.\nWhen I pay my chamber dues, I do not mark it up\nas an expense. No indeed, I count it an investment\u2014an\ninvestment not only in my town and my community,\nbut an investment in my business and my future as well.\u2019\nF{>r whatever helps one person and one business helps\nother people and other businesses. Most of us get our\nshare one way or the other.\n! In closing, may I remind you of that old saying about\nthe banana: When it leaves the bunch it gets skinned.\n\u00ab So let\u2019s stick together, let\u2019s work together, let\u2019s carry\nshare of the burden and responsibiliyt. Let\u2019s build a\ntugger and better Dunn. If you aren\u2019t a member of the\nChamber, drop by the offices today and pay your dues.\n* D&n\u2019t increase the burden by making it necessary\nffcr somebody to have to go to see you.\nFrederick OTHMAN\nMcLEAN, Va.\u2014l have about come\nto (he conclusion that the genius\nwho invented the edible dish is the\nHero of the age. At least he's my\nboy;,, - '\nTwo long years ago- he received\na patent on the disappearing din\nner \"Jilate.

' \u2019l\u2019hen having consumed tire\nfood, she and her spouse also would\ncat \u2018their plates.\nThose, of course, were made ac\ncording to his formula of a sub\nstance something like that of the\nwe-Cream cone, only tougher to\nwithstand the knife and fork. I\nwrote a little piece for the paper\nabout him at the time, but nobody\nelse paid any attention.\nEven I, over the protests of Mrs.\n0., bought an electric dishwasher\nto handle our old-style, non-edible\nplates. For the most part this has\nbeen a superb investment, even\nthough it did wash off some of\nthe gold on the teapot. -It has\ncleaned our dishes perfectly and\u2014\nimportant to me\u2014it also has dried\nthem. 1 haven\u2019t touched a cup tow\nel since it was installed under the\nsink.\nI did not complain (not serious\nly, that in) when a peculiar olium\nThese Days\n\u00a3ckeUktf\nTRUMAN'S CANDIDACY\nFrom the standpoint of the Unit\ned States, it is sound that Harry\nTruman should run for the Presi\ndency. That means that his oppo\nnent will have ample opportunity\nto attack the policies and practices\nof his administration. Should the\nopponent be Senator Taft, the de\nbate will be clear-cut and positive.\nTaft will go to as many whistie\nstops as Truman, and the pfeople\nwill hear both sides.\nHarry Truman's reference to mar\ntyrdom Oia Congressman Sabath is,\nof course, campaign talk with no\nmeaning. While the Presidency is\na difficult task, few, if any, Presi\ndents have died of it. Woodrow\nWilson's tumor on the brain was\nnot a product of the Presidency,\nfor it comes to many a person who\nis not President; Coolidge and\nHarding did not die of over-work;\nHerbert Hoover is still alive, thank\nGod. Franklin D. Roosevelt died of\na cerebral hemorrhage. Certainly,\nwith the high incidence of death\nfrom cardiac and arterial causes\nin this country, it is impossible for\nanyone to say that the Presidency\nis in particular, a killer.\nMen rarely die from over-work:\nover - eating and poorly - balanced\ndiets seem to do more mischief, as\nall the statistics on the subject\nshow.\nThese references to Mr. Truman's\nprospective martyrdom are only a\nprelude to the more important point\nthat it is altogether unnecessary.\nIf Mr. Truman finds the task of\nbeing President so perilous, there\nsurely is no need for him to con\ntinue in that office. Many Demo\ncrats and many Republicans would\ngladly assume the risk. Senator\nKafauver is travelling the country\nto inform the citizens of his aspi\nration to lay down his life for his\ncountry in the White House and it\nis reported that many Democrats\nwould prefer such a man as Senator\nRichard Russell.\nAs for the Republicans, Senator\nRobert A. Taft is already whistle\nstopping to establish his availability\nand General Eisenhower\u2019s support\ners proclaim his readiness far and\nwide. Harold Stassen is rdady and\nwilling and Governor Sari Warrsm\nof California has placed\u2019 hftfise!f~ :\nin position, so that, come what\nmay. California, with its huge con\nvention delegation, may no longer\nbe treated as a distant cousin.\nSurely, with so many willing to\nassume the perils of high office,\nit is not necessary to embarrass\nPresident Truman. He can readily\navoid martyrdom and if, as Con\ngressman Sabath indicated, there\nis a distaste for a killing job. other\njobs may be found. Coolidge and\nHoover became directors of life in\nsurance companies and A1 Smith,\nif you recall, took over the man\nagement of an office building, hav\ning lost the opportunity to test the\nstresses and strains of the White\nHouse.\nIt is understandable that Mr.\nTruman would sacrifice himself for\npeace. So would we all. On the\nother hand, Mr. Truman has given\nno evidence of his owr proficiency\nin peace-making. Out of his labors\nhave come the \u201ccold war\u201d in Eu\nrope and the \"hot war\u201d in Asia.\nPerhaps i*. is not his fault but that\nof Joe Stalin whom he met at\n*Vf dam and liked. Yet, no peace\nh , come out of the huge expendi\ntures to attain it.\nA public official lives by his\nrecord and no matter whose fault\nit is that mistakes are made, the\nchief cf state must bear the re\nsponsibility. Thus, when a policy\nof peace produces war and costs\nthe taxpayer about $100,000,000,000\na year, there is cauke to wonder\nwhether his profession of peaceful\nintentions is not made of the stuff\nwith which Hell is paved.\nIt is difficult to ignore the fact\nthat from Potsdam to the dismissal\nof MacArthur. the Truman peace\npolicy was such that the United\nStates came out of it with loss of\ndignity and even humiliation. We\nwent into Potsdam the most pow\nerful nation on earth: we are today\nnqt in that position, having lost\ncontrol of the air, the atom bomb,\nand leadership in the United Na\ntions. In fact, at the recent ses\nsions in Paris of the General As\nsembly, the number of nations vot\ning against this country or ab\nstaining from voting with us, gives\nthe impression that buying allies\nis a dangerous enterprise because\nthey do not stay bought. A policy\nbased on profligacy embarrasses the\ntaker as much as it distresses the\ngiver.\nAs desirable as peace is, it must\nnot be a token political effort'aim\ned to confuse the electorate.\nof accidental circumstances got the\ndishwasher hooked up with the\ngarbage chopper - upper, which\nsprayed the plates with an emul\nsion of shredded cabbage leaves\nand pulverized egg shells. This was\neasily fixed by adjustment of a\nbutterfly valve on the washer out\nlet; did it myself, in fact, after a\ncouple of hours of exploring with\na monkey wrench.\nSo the months passed peacefully\nm the Othman kitchen with all the\nmachinery doing its duty at a\ntouch of the proper button.

J. Bracken\nLee, the subject of government\nspending came up. I though I had\nsaid some rather strong things a\nbout certain forms of government\nwaste but found I was mild com\npared with the new Republican\nGovernor of Utah-\nA delightful \u2019and vigorous per\nson, the Governor claimed that\ngovernment spending was \"creep\ning Soclaism.*\u2019 the ruination of the\nnation, and that practically all\nspending should be curtailed by\nWashington. I tried to point out\nthat certain states and even big\nbusiness might squalvk to high\nheaven if \"Creeping Socialism\u201d was\nstopped but the governor is an en\nergetic talker, and I fear I was not\ntoo convincing.\nLater I did some research on\n\u201cCreeping Socialism\" and its bene\nfits to certain states and business\ngroups. Here are the results:\nU. S. STEEL CORPORATION\nBiggest boon to Utah has been the\noperation of a steel mill at Geneva.\nGovernor Lee told me this greatly\nincreased the population of Sait\nLake City and the surrounding area\nand contributed generously to local\nprosperity\njflowever. the U. \u00bb. Steel Oorp.\nat first opposed the production of\nsteel in Utah. Judge Elbert Gary,\nformer head of U. S. Steel, scoffed\nat the idea when I interviewed him\nmany years ago, and his successors\ncontinued to scoff even after\nPearl Harbor. In fact, they were\nso opposed to western steel pro\nduction that the federal govern\nment had to take the initiative it\nself for the Geneva plant.\nUncle Sam took all the risk and\nafter proving that the steel in\ndustry in the Far West could be\nsuccessful, then U. S. Steel, sup\nported by some astute lobbying by\nex-Gov. Herh\u00bbrt Maw of Utah and\nex-Sen. Abe Murdoch, got the fed\neral government to sell the Geneva\nplant to U. S. Steel for about 20 on\nthe dollar.\nThe steel plant cost the tax\npayers $191,326,000. It was sold to\nU. S. Steel for $47175,000. Direct\nsubsidy to U. S. Steel and the state\nof Utah was $144,151,000.\nFORT DOUGLAS, UTAH On\nthe foothills just above Salt Lake\nCity stands Fort Douglas, an im\nportant army installation. After the\nwar, a large hunk of the Fort\u2019s\nterritory, plus important buildings,\nwere turned over to Governor Lee\u2019s\nState of Utah, and are now a part\nof the University of Utah.\nAIRLINES SUBSIDIES Utah,\nan inland state, benefits from quick\nairline transportation. Most people\ndon\u2019t realize it. but the airlines,\nthrough now big business, get an\nannual subsidy of $95,000,000\nthrough \u201cCreeping Socialism.\u201d On\nCUTIES\ntan ,\u00bbt iikc rum it, I, - .\u00bbf\n\u201cThe very FIRST thing we\u2019ll do is drive over and pick up\nmother *\ntop of this they get the advantage\nof 70,000 miles of air lanes serviced\nby radio range stations, beacons and\ntraffic controls, all paid for by the\nfederal government. The railroads\nhave to pay for their own signals,\ntelegraph and upkeep of their\ntracks, while the airlines get like\nlike services free. In addition, the\nairplanes get the use of airports,\nusually supplied by municipalities,\ntax-free. The railroads pay taxes\non their property.\nIn 1951 the taxpayers shelled out\n$21,361,040 to construct new towers,\nbeacons, and radar for the air\nways, plus another $73,931,733 for\npersonnel to operate these safety\naids, plus another $37,000,000 for\nrunways and construction work at\nairports.\nThe airlines are now big busi*ess.\nI agree with Governor Lee that this\nis \u201cCreeping Socialism,\" But he\u2019ll\nfind that big business will be the\nfist to howl if it\u2019s stopped.\nSHIPPING , SUBSIDIES Also\nthe first to yell if we stop \u201cCreep\ning Socialism\u201d will be another big\nbusiness group, the shipping lines.\nAmerican shipowners get $30,000,000\nannually in operating subsidies. On\ntefc of this the United States Lines\nlast year got a construction subsidy\nof $18,225,000 plus an indirect 1 ' sub\nsidy of $24,061,000 for national de\nfense In building the new vessel,\nthe United States,\nAmerican exports Lines is due to\nget a $26,000,000 subsidy for the\nIndependence and The Constitution,\nbut after Controller General I.ind\nsay Warren objected to \"Creeping\nSocialism\u201d and proposed curtail\ning subsidies, the American Export\nLines threatened to dump the ships\nin the lap of Uncle Sam.\nPUBLIC ROADS Another form\nof Creeping Socialism is the gov\nernment\u2019s annual subsidy to the\n.States to build highways. This costs\nthe federal taxpayers about half\na billion dollars a year and is al\nlocated to Governor Lee of Utah\nand the other 47 states.\nIf this were curtailed every bus\nline, trucking company, and many\nprivate motorists would be at the\ndoor of '\"ongress in about 24 hours\ndemanding that \u201cCreeping Social\nism\u201d for the highways be reinstated.\nDOCTORS SUBSIDIES ln\nUtah. Sen. Elbert Thomas was de\nfeated partly because he favored a\npublic health bill. The doctors rose\nup in arms against him, called him\nan exponent of creeping socialism.\nWhat the public doesn\u2019t realize,\nhowever, is that the doctors got\ntheir own direct subsidy in the\nform of $39,578,000 from the fed\neral government last year, much\nof it going to medical Institutions\nfor research. However, this money\nis largely in the form of gifts so\nthat the doctors control it once they\nget it from the government.

But\nat nights I am ready for bed a\nround 11 o\u2019clock. My husband's\nworking hours are variable. Some\ndays he goes to the job very enrly;\nother days he doesn\u2019t have \u2666. re\nport until nearly noon The days\nhe goes early T am up with a song\nin my heart, eager to tackle my\nchores and get them done. \u25a0\nAndy's late morning hours are\nmy problem. He likes to sleep late\nand he does, and this is quite all\nright with me. But he objects to\nmy rising early, and wears an In\njured air when I do. He says I\nneed my rest and should stay in\nbed with him; which is an alibi,\nbecause we don\u2019t sleep when I do.\nI have tried loafing the momtng\naway, to please him; :but I get very\nirritated and out of sorts, wasting\ntime, lying abed.\nThe dispute has developed only\nrecentlysince our children are\ngrown and gone. In other years\nI had to be up early to get them\noff to school, and later to see them\noff to work. Now there Is no com\npulsion for me to rise early, but\nstill I prefer it. And I contend that\nIf I don\u2019t mind how lortg Andy\nstays In bed so long as he doesn't\ntry to keep me there then he\nshouldn\u2019t be cross about my early\nrising.\nThe conflict may seem trivial, and\nI know I shouldn't let it bother\nme; but it keeps popping back in\nto my mind and is definitely Irri\ntating. Naturally I feel that I\nam right, and that Andy Is being\nunreasonable; but we can be so\nwrong where our emotions are\nconcerned. So lt deems best to\ntry to settle the matter by getting\nan impartial opinion; and I am\nwilling to change my viewpoint If\nI am wrong.

C.\nThese \u2022 Days\ni9k r* r'***\"\u2022\nEISENHOWER\nThe campaign to matte General\nFlsenhowe- a presidential nominee\nfor one of the two major political\nparties is now in full blast. Almost\nsimultaneously, the \u2018\u2018New York\nTribune\" n\u2019amed him as. its can\ndidate, \u201cCollier's?\u2019 published an ar\nticle by Leonard V. Finder an\nnouncing that Eisenhower would\naccept a nomination by\u2019 either\nparty, and a news story stated that\na headquarters for him would be\nestablished at Topeka. Kansas.\nEven Genera! Eisenhower\u2019s most\nardent supporters have to recog\nnize that politically this is not good\nenough, for no direct word has\ncome from General Eisenhower. In\nfact, his headquarters stated:\n\u201cThis is a military headquarters\nand we cannot be expected to com\nment on the views of an editorial\nin a purely political matter. There\nis no change contemplated in Gen\neral Eisenhower\u2019s military status,\nabout which this headquarters has\noeen informed.\u201d\nAdmittedly, the position of Gen\neral Eisenhower is difficult and\nembarrassing. As supreme com\nmander of NATO, he cannot be\ncome involved in the internal poli\ntics of his own country. While\nserving *n uniform under President\nTruman, he cannot oppose him po\nlitically. All this. General Eisen\nhower was told by Iriendly persons\noefore he went to Europe. He was\nfold that such a complex situation\nwas inevitab.c ana that he ought\nto make his choice in advance of\nthe campaign \u2018cr his nomination.\nOthers counseled him that his po\nsition in Europe would improve -lis\npolitical stature\nUntil General Eisenhower him\nself publ\u2019cly p-oc\u2019aims himself a\nRepublican, which he has never\ndone, amt that he seeks the nomi\nnation and would accept it, the\npoliticians who control state dele\ngations to the convention will\navoid, as far as possible, commit\nments which may prove embarras\nsing to them at the convention.\nGeneral Eisenhower, further\nmore, is being presented in a ftilse\nlight by those who are publiply\nsupporting him. The \"New York\nHerald Tribune\" was one of the\nDrincipal advocates cf Wendell\nWillkie, which is likely to frighten\nMiddle-Western Republicans.\nMr. Finder has nq status in the\nRepublican Party. His claim to\nface is that in 194?. General Eisen\nhower wrote to him stating that\n\u201cit is my conviction that the nec\nessary and wise subordination of\nthe military to c\u2019vil power will be\nbes\u2019 sustained, and our people will\nhave greater confidence that it is\nsos sustained, when lifelong pro\nfessional soldier:, in the absence of\nsome obvious and overriding rea\nson, abstain from seeking high po\nlitical office.\u201d\nNowhere m h:s article does M.t\nTinder publisn a statement pre\npared by or signed by General\nE\u2019senhower acknowledging that he\nis a candidate and will accept if\nchosen. All tha* appears is Mr.\nF*>\u2019 r\u2019s political judgment. But\nthere is no ;v d. to indicate that\nMr. Finder's pc: tical judgment is\npolitically important.\nThe real danger for the Eisen\nhower candidacy is that his friends\nare placing him in the awkward\nposition of being Tom Dewey\u2019s\ncandidate supported by the inter\nnationalist crowd in the east. To\nprofessional politicians this means\na split party for the following rea\nsons:\n1. It is based not on a desire\nto support Eisenhower but to use\nhim to block Taft and to bring\nDewey in as a compromise\n2 He is being used as a political\nrpfuge by a discredited crowd who\nhave kept Republicans at logger\nheads and defeated since 1940 when\nthey prdected Wendell Willkie.\nThis same grouu ic regarded as re\nsponsible for the agreement be\ntween Rooseve't and Dewey to lim\nit the debate in 1944:\n3. It is perilous to say, as Eisen\nhower\u2019s f'iends do, that if the Re\npublicans do not nominate him, he\nwould accept a Democratic nomi\nnation. This is an admission that\nhe is not a Republican but a mave\nrick who will accept any brand\nFurther, it implies that he is above\nparty and therefore will not func\ntion as a Remiblican if elected.\nAll of this adds up to three\npoints:\n1. General Eisenhower must de\nclare himself a Republican:\n2. He must declare himself a can\ndidate who will accept the nomi\nnation, come what may. No man\ncan lead a party who in his mind\nor occupation is greater than his\nparty:\n3. He must state his platform\u2014\nh;s domestic and foreign platform\n\u2014before the convention, as no\nparty can afford this year to buy\n3 pig in a poke.\nA political party In the United\nStates is a state organization which\nselects delegates tc a national con\nvention. To many leaders, the state\nand congressional elections are of\nequal importance to the presiden\ntial election. They will not risk\ntne former for an uncertainty in I\nthe latter if they can help it. That\nTHE DAILY RECORD, DUNN, N.

Sherwood, who penned \u201cThe Petrified Forest,\u201d disclaims\ncredit for casting Humphrey Bogart as Duke Mantee in that play.\n\u201cI wanted \u2019Bogie\u2019 for the show,\u201d says Sherwood, \u201cbut I wanted him\nfor an incidental part, that of the footbal player. When we were casting,\nI suggested this to Arthur Hopkins and he startled me by saying that\nhe had already contacted Bogart.\n\u201cWhen rehearsals started, I was flaobergasted to find that Mr. Hop\nkins had cast Bogart as the mobster. This was startling, because up to\nthat time. Bogart always had plftyed the role of juven\u2019le. Yet Hopkins'\ntheatre sense was so perceptive that the minute Bogart read the first\nlines, it was obvious that Arthur had made a ten-strike. Bogart was mag\nnificent. But the credit should go to Hopkins.\u201d\nLegends, often inaccurate, take on the patina of time and it becomes\nheretical to deny them.\nThe late William A. Brady always was credited \u2022 erroneously with\nchoosing Helen Hayes for a revival of Sir James Barrie\u2019s \u201cWhat Every\nWoman Knows\u201d In 1926.\nOne of the last times I chatted with Mr. Brady he recalled this and\ndenied it vehemently. \u201cActually, all I wanted, at the time, was some sort\nof an attraction for four weeks. My wife. Grace George, was the one who\nsuggested Helen Hayes and I've been given credit ever since. Her choice\nwas so brilliant and Miss Hayes so tremendous that what I\u2019d considered\na stop-gap attraction ran 96 weeks!\u201d\nPicking a play and casting it imposes an equal strain on producer and\nstar.

Denny got himself a job as\nlaborer in the WPA-\nBy dint of vast shoveling and/or\ntalking, he worked his way up to\nhe WPA administrator for Mass\nachusetts He now was a pal of\neverybody of importance in New\nEngland political circles. He was a\nbanquet speaker leader in charity\ndrives, and frequent commuter to\nWashington.\nNobody was surprised in 1944\nwhen he became Collector of In\nterna! Revenue in Boston. Now Den\nny was on his own. He made a_ca\nreer of extracting a profit from\u2019the\nbad luck of nis fellow Bostonians.\nFor those who paid their taxes\nhe had a jovial step on the back;\nfor those who hadn\u2019t, he offered\na deal. A egbaret owner who for\ngot his taxes gave Denny free rent\non the beach An assortment of\ngents who owed back taxes paid\none of Denny\u2019s pais for advice. The\npal split with the collector.\nIn 1949 Denny was down to his\ntest Cadillac and that an old one.\nSo he dropped out to see Jordan\nPatkin of the Ferry Street Motor\nSales Co., in suburban Malden, to\nbuy a new one.\nThe fancy new job with the white\ntires was worth $4,500. Patkin of\nfered him $2,000 on his old heap.\nDenny said he'd think that over.\nHe returned a few days later for\na conference with Louis Patkin,\nthe late father of the Cadillac deal\nto spend the weekend.

'\ng- Listen Americans!\ng\ne BY GEORGE 8. BENSON\niR President of Harding College\nThe workers of Russia now have waited 40 years for the\nCommunist government to live up to the promises of Com\nmunism-Socialism. They have waited in vain. The promises\nof Communism and Socialism are pipe dreams. They could\nnever come true. The workers of Hungary learned this, and\nnow they have told the world about it in a brief tragic surge\nfor freedom. The workers of Russia know it too, but since they\nare living in an overpowering Police State they haven\u2019t _\\'etl\nmustered the courage to revolt on any big scale. |\nKarl Marx, its founder, called Communism \u201cscientific\nSocialism.\u201d His present-day followers call it \u201cscientific Social\nism\u201d or just plain \u201cSocialism.\u201d Socialism is the economic sys\ntem in Russia today. In its economic workings it is the same\nbrand of Socialism operating in England\u2019s \u201cnationalized\u201d in\ndustries, in India\u2019s Socialist system, in Israel, and in all the\nother Socialist countries.\nMr. Peter F. Hurst, Michigan industralist, has revorted\nafter a careful study of conditions inside Russia that \u201cscien\ntific Socialism\u201d has brought the Russian people only poverty\nand slavery\u2014except for the two to three million functionaries\nin the sprawling government bureaucracy who lives like kings.\nAnd now, reporting in United States News & World Report,\na Virginia research-educator, G. Warren Nutter, makes the\nsame kind of report.\nProfessor Nutter visited a number of Russian factories\nand observed \u201cscientific Socialism\u201d at work. One was a factory\nat Leningrad producing curtains, tablecloths, etc. Before\nSocialism Communism took over, it was operated as a private\nenterprise. \u201cThe building, almost all the machinery and a great\ndeal of the technology,\u201d noted Professor Nutter, \u201cobviously\ntsarist period.\n\u201cExcept for one floor of new spinning and winding equip\nment built in the Soviet Union and East Germany . . . the\nmachinery is of English. German and French design, as in\nstalled around 1886. Much of the power is transmitted\nthrough overhead belt lines, a relic of the days when steam\nengines were used as prime movers. The rooms are dark, dirty\nand crowded with machines. Not even primitive safety equip\nment is to be seen. Graphite is used as a lubricant, and it\ncovers, everything with its characteristic black and slippery\ncoating\u2014stairs. walls. railings and workers. . .\n\u201cOn the whole this plant looked like something out of\nthe nineteenth century . . .\u201d Some of the other plants visited\nby Professor Nutter were newer and more.modern but at the\nend of all his travels and studies he concluded that the Soviet\neconomy is 50 vears behind America\u2019s. Let\u2019s guard against the\ngrowth of Government power in our own system. Our pros\nperity and freedom are at stake.\nMorgantown, W.

I can only add,\nthank Cod; for if they were to put up a peace program\nsomewhat along the lines of Wilson\u2019s Fourteen Points\nthey would undoubtedly create great difficulties for us.\u201d\nAs early as March 27, 1942, less than four months after\nPearl Harbor, the little doctor had noted that America\u2019s\ninitial propaganda drive against the Reich constituted \u201ca\ncertain danger\u201d and was a \u201cmuch more clever form\u201d of attack\nthan that employed by the British.\n\u201cIf 1 were on the enemy side,\u201d he wrote. \u201c1 should\nhave adopted the slogan of fighting against Nazism, but\nnot against the German people. That\u2019s how Chamber\nlain began . . . but, thank God, the English didn\u2019t fol\nlow through.\u201d\nSo afraid was Goebbels of the American psychological\napproach that he even forbade his press stooges to attempt to\nrefute our arguments. \u201cOne should simply not talk about\nthese things,\u201d he held. \u201cEven if you argue about them,\nyou spread them.\u201d\nContrast these fears of Nazism\u2019s chief chronicler with his\nunalloyed joy at the Vansittart approach:\nAfter His Lordship on March 18, 1942 had delivered a\nspeech in the House of Lords, Goebbels commented:\n\u201cV ansittart . . . demands propaganda directed\nagainst Germany as such and not against National\nSocialism. He wants to destroy Germany, not the\nNational Socialist movement. That\u2019s music for our ears.\nLet Vansittart carry on.\u201d\nOn April 24, 1943, he suggested that a monument ought to\nbe erected to His Lordship in Germany with the inscription,\n\u2018\u2018To the Englishman who rendered the greatest service to the\nGerman cause during the war.\u201d\nWhat if we had attempted to strengthen the opponents of\nNazism within the Reich instead of welding them together\nwith all Germans in a community of despair? Could we not\nhave had victory at a cheaper price?\nIt is safe to say that wherever dictatorship and tyranny\nexists, there are men and women who oppose it. They may be\ncomparatively few in number; they will almost certainly be\nweak as a military force. But the drive to be free is powerful\nand sustaining. If encouragement and help can reach them,\nthey will assist us out of all proportion to their size.\nThe alternative we already know.\n\u201cThe mure radical the English are in prophesying a\ndisgraceful peace fur Germany,\u201d Goebbels\u2019 entry for\nMarch 26, 1942, informs us, \u201cthe more easily I succeed in\ntoughening German resistance.

Pulliam\nNertfc American Newspaper Alliance\nLondon, April jo\u2014 After\nspending ten days in England. I\nam at a complete loss to under\nstand how an intelligent Amer\nican can advocate the adoption of\nany part of the British system of\nsocialist government for use in\nAmerica.\nThe contrast in living condi\ntions, in personal freedom and in\nopportunity ia so sharp that every\ncomparison is in America's favor.\nAmerica is Utopia compared to\nEngland today. It is a common\nmistake of almost all people to\nbelieve that the pastures are\ngreener on the other side of the\nfence. English pastures definitely\nare not greener, when surveyed\nby an American. They are drab\nand grim. Here are some things\nAmericans should Jcnow and\nwhich explain why England is the\nuninviting place it is today:\nThe government owns and op\nerates the railroads, the buses,\nthe trucking lines, the street rail\nways, the electric and gas utili\nties, the national bank and the\nmines. Therefore, whenever you\nuse any of the services of these\nessential utilities, you must deal\nwith a civil servant.\nThe socialist leaders have\npledged themselves to take over\nthe steel industry, all the insur\nance companies, the cement in\ndustry and \u201cany other industry\nwhich doesn\u2019t do a good job for\nthe public..\u201d\nAgriculture By Regulation.\nThe English farmers are com\npelled to operate their farms\nstrictly according to the orders of\nthe minuter of agriculture. Fail\nure to follow the plan subjects\nthe farmer to the penalty of hav\ning the government sell the farm\nand put him off the land.\nEnglish housewives spend hours\nand hours every week in the\nmarkets trying to find enough\nfood at a price they can afford,\nto keep their families going. There\nis no such thing as delivery serv\nice for 90 per cent of English\nhomes.\nAutomobile licenses eost from\n$45 to $265 a year. Whereas\npractically 90 per cent of Ameri\ncan families have automobiles.\n^NSQUALITY*\nHurry! Don\u2019t Miss This Sensational Event!\nCUSTOM\u2019S 36th\n* ANNIVERSARY SALE\n3 YR.

The Navy has impounded na\ntive savings, thus making it im\npossible for islanders to bid for\nlarge-scale commercial leases.\n2. The Navy has imposed a maxi\nmum wage scale of 5 to 7 cents an\nhour for common labor and 9 tc\n11% cents an hour for skilled labor,\nMr. Collier called these \u201ccoolie\nrates.\u201d\n3.

Judge Price inform\ned them in the courtroom that if\nthey behaved themselves well they\nmight be released before the age of\n21.\nThe rejection of Lynn\u2019s plea for\nmodification exhausts the remedies\navailable in the juvenile courts. He\nis now preparing to file papers in\nSuperior Court. Since the Superior\nCourt of Union County is not pres\nently in Session, Mr. Lynn intends\nto return soon to North Carolina\nand institute action in the court\nof an adjoining county.\nA principal point being made by\nLynn in brief is that young Simp\nson and Thompson did not receive\ndue process of law or a proper\ntrial under the latitude permitted\nin juvenile cases. What occurred\nrather was a \u201cseparate but equal\u201d\ntrial. The judge first held a hear\ning for the whites involved in the\ncase\u2014the seven-year-old girl, her\nplaymate, and their parents. Later\nin the day he conducted a trial for\nthe Negro children. Though their\nmothers were permitted to be pres\nent, having been first informed of\nthe trial but a few minutes before,\nthey had not time to secure counsel.\nRobert F. Williams, president .of\nthe local NAACP, for whom they\nhad sent, was not allowed to onter\nthe courtroom.\nThus the two Negro children |\nwere denied counsel, denied the I\nI\nSouth African...\n(Continued from Page One)\n91 appeared for formal trial on a\ncharge of high treason.\nBefore ever the government\u2019s\nlawyers got to offering evidence\nagainst them, the defense camp\nlaunched a strong legal attack on\nthe indictment and after question\ning by the Supreme Court judgee\nhearing the action, the prosecution\nwithdrew the indictment.\nDespite the collapse of the case\nat that stage, however, it is far\nfrom ended. The government\u2019s law\nyers have drafted a new indict\nment and the case is to begin all\nover again\u2014with the accused just\nabout where they were at the be\nginning of the whole affair.\nThe prosecution has split the\naccused into two groups\u201430 will\nappear on Jan. 19 and the remain\ning 61 on April 20. Thus although\nthey havt been \u2022allowed bail since\ntwo weeks after their original de\ntention, the shadow of the trial\nand its 'possible outcome may hang\nover them for many more months.\nThe trial has brought upheaval\nto the lives of most of them. Long\ndays of attendance in court have\nlost many of them their jobs and\nincomes. Some families have mov\ned their homes from cities else\nwhere to Johannesburg or Pretoria,\nthe respective scenes of the pre\nliminary hearing and the trial\nproper.\nAlready the Treason Trial De\nfense Fund, using money collected\nin South Africa, Britain, and the\nUnited States, has expended $210,\n000 on legal costs and essential ex\npenses computed on a most modest\nscale.\nThe new indictment against the\naccused takes a new legal tack in\nthat it makes reference to violence.\nPreviously the prosecution case ap\npeared to be directed against \u201ccon\nspiracy\u201d to overthrow the state,\nyet omitted any allegation of a\nsingle act of violence.\nNow, however, although there is\nstill no allegation of any act of\nrigrht to hear or confront accusers\nand witnesses against them. In\ndeed, the mothers were not even\nafforded an opportunity to speak \u25a0\nto their sons privately and learn i\ntheir version of what had happened. i\nThe two boys had been heid in- I\ncommunicado in the jail for six j\ndays and the mothers saw them j\nonly in the courtroom.\nviolence having been committed,\nthe new indictment charges that\nthe achievement of their alleged\naims \u201cwould to the knowledge of\nthe accused necessarily involve the\noverthrow of the state by violence.\u201d\nThe indictment cites five of these\nalleged demands as being:\n1. The right to vote;\n2. \u201cRestoration of the national\nwealth of the country to the peo\nple\u201d;\n3. Transference of the \u201cmineral\nwealth beneath the soil, the banks\nand monopoly industry\u201d to the\n\u201cownership of the people as a\nwhole\u201d;\n4. The ending of \u201cland owner\nship on a racial basis\u201d and its re\ndivision \u201camong those who work\nit, to banish famine and land hung\ner\u201d; and\n5. The right of all to occupy land\nwherever they choose.\nThe prosecution\u2019s case is thus\napparently that these ends can\nnot be achieved in South Africa\nwithout the violent overthrow of\nthe state, and to advocate such\nthings is therefore treason.\nMeanwhile, summing up his im\npressions of the trial to date, Har\nvard Law School\u2019s Dean Erwin N.\nGriswold, who attended the formal\ntrial\u2019s opening stages as an ob\nserver, has written in The Times\n(of London):\n\u201cNo question can be raised about\nthe competency or the capacity of\nthe court . . . Nevertheless, no mat\nDr.DiBois...\n(Continued from Page One)\nbatim in the Guardian.\nIn his speech, the aged Negro\nsocialist, who was denied by this\ncountry the right to travel abroad\nbecause of his leftwing views, ex\nhorted the ^representatives of the\n7 free nations of Africa, gathered\nin Ghana, to reject capitalism.\n\u201cThe African tribe, whence all of\nyou sprung, was communistic in\nits very beginnings. No tribesman\nwas free. All were servants of the\ntribe of whom the chief was father\nand voice,\u201d DuBois contended.\nHe urged the Africans to do\nwithout, rather than buy western\ngoods, or borrow from capitalist\ncountries. He said:\n\u201cYou can not only beat down the\nprice of capital as offered by the\nunited and monopolized Western\nprivate capitalists, but . . . you\ncan compare their offers with those\nof socialist countries like the So\nviet Union and China which . . .\nare . . . able to offer weak na\ntions needed capital on better terms\nthan the West.\n\u201cIts acceptance,\u201d he contended,\n\u201cinvolves no bonds which a free\nAfrica may not safely assume. It\ncertainly does not involve slavery\nand colonial control which the\nWest has demanded and still de\nmands.\n\u201cPrivate capitalism is doomed,\u201d\nDr. DuBois insisted. He defined\nsocialism, toward which he said\nthe \u201cwhole world, including capi\ntalist countries, is moving . . .\ninevitably, inexorably,\u201d as \u201cdisci\nplined economy and political or\nganization in which the first duty\nof a citizen is to serve the state.\u201d\nThe state, he indicated, is \u201cthe\nmass of workers with hand and\nbrain.\u201d He contended that \u201cgrad\nter how fair and competent a court\nmay be, if the underlying legal\nsituation is deeply unsound the\ncourt may, simply because it must\nact according to law, be compelled\nto unsound results . . .\n\u201cThe world . . . need have no\nconcern about the-formal adequacy\nof the trial . . . about adequate\nprocedures and a fair hearing. It\nmay well be concerned that there\nshould be such a trial at all . . .\nThe free world cannot be uncon\ncerned when there is a land where\n80 per cent of the people are un\nfree.\u201d\nJACKSON ADVOCATE\ni\nOP\nBROOKLYN, N.

This would be a\ngrave mistake,\u201d he said.\n\u201cCapital offered you at high\nprice by the colonial powers like ;\nFrance, Britain, Holland, Belgium, ]\nand the U.

We will bury\nlyou.\u201d \u2022\n> Crowd Applauds\nThere was applause from the\ncheering section and Mr. Go\nmulka, who had been standing\nat one side rather glumly. 1\n' laughed.\nThe Soviet Communist chief\n: tain said many mistakes had\nbeen made in building socialism\nin the Soviet Union because of'\nthe lack of examples and the\nlack of personnel.\nHe continued: \u2022 j\n\u201cIf we could have the revolu\ntion over again, we would carry\nit out more sensibly and with\nsmaller losses. But history does\nnot repeat itself. The situation\nis favorable for us. If God ex\nisted. we would thank Him for\nthis \u201d\nMr. Khrushchev then switched\nto the Hungarian situation:\n\"On Hungary\u2014we had Hun\ngary thrust upon us. We are\nvery sorry that such a situation\nexists there. We are sure that\nthe Hungarian working class will\n\u2022find the strength to overcome the\ndifficulties. But the most im\nportant thing is that the counter\n; revolution must be shattered.\n\u201cDear comrades, gentlemen,\nthey accuse us of interferring in\nHungary's internal affairs. They j\nAnd the most fearful words to;\naccuse us.\n\u201cBut at the same time (Brit-j\nish Prime Minister) Eden says\nabout Egypt that that is not\nwar, that it is only a police\naction. When the British, French\nand Israelis cut the throats of\nthe Egyptians, that is only a\npolice action aimed at restoring\norder. But what order is this?\n\"No. for us it is the order of\nthe colonizers. The order of en\nslavement, the domination of\nstrong over the weak.\u201d\nI Turning to Mr. Gomulka, Mr I\nKhrushchev said:\n\u201cI am sorry to be making such;\na speech on the (embassy) terri\ntory. of a foreign state. The\nWestern powers are trying to\ndenigrate Nasser, although Nas\nser is hot a Communist. Politi\ncally he is closer to those who\nare waging war on him and he\nhas even put Communists in\njail.\u201d\nBelittles Israel\nI Here, Soviet President Kle\nmenti Voroshilov commented:\n\u201cHe had to \u201d\nMr. Khrushchev turned to the\npresident with a smile and said:\n\"Don\u2019t try to help me.\u201d\n; Then he continued:\nI \u201cBut he. Nasser, is fighting for\nindependence. He is the hero\nof his nation and our sympathies\nare on his side.\n\u201cWe sent sharp letters to\nBritain, France and Israel\u2014well,'\nIsrael, that was just for form\u2014!\nbecause as you know Israel car\nries no weight in the world, and\nuif it plays any role it was just;\n-| to start a fight.\n\u201cIf Israel hadn\u2019t felt the sup\nport of Britain. Prance and\nt others, the Arabs would have\n; been able to box her ears and she\n. would have remained at peace.\n\u201cThe situation is serious and\nr we are realists. The fire must be\nput out. I think the British and\nFrench will be wise enough to\n, withdraw their forces and then\n| Egypt will emerge stronger than\never.\n\u201cWe must seek a reapproach\nment. We must seek a settle\nment so that coexistence will be\npeaceful and advantageous.\u201d\nI West\u2019s Position \u201cIdiotic\u201d\nj Referring to the Soviet gov\nernment\u2019s latest disarmament\nplan and talking to the West, he\nwent on:\n\u201cYou say we want war. but\nyou now have got yourselves into\na position I would call Idiotic.\u201d\nMr. Mikoyan interjected: \u201cLet\u2019s\nsay delicate.\u201d\nMr. Khrushchev continued:\n\u201cBut we don\u2019t want to profit\nby it. If you withdraw your\ntroops from Germany, France\nand Britain\u2014l\u2019m speaking of\nAmerican troops\u2014we will not\nstay one day in Poland. Hungary\nand Romania.\n\u201cBut we. Mister Capitalists,\nwe are beginning to understand\nyour methods,\" he said with\nscorn in his voice. \u201cYou have\ngiven us a lesson in Egypt. If\nwe had a quarter of our present\nfriendship for the Poles, Czechs\nand Slovaks before the war\n(World War II), the war would\nnever have started.\nj \u201cDon\u2019t let us repeat the mis\ntake that has tauglt us a lesson,\niNo one must claim his method\nof socialism is the best. We must\nnot transform our country into\na sausage shop. ,\n\u201cI Envy the Chinese\u201d\n\u201cI bow my head before the\nChinese because they have very\ncarefully solved some of their\nproblems. I envy the Chinese.\n\u201cNobody should pretend to\nsknow the best methods of so\ncialism. The Bulgarians, Poles,\nYugoslavs, Romanians, Czechs\nand Soviets all have their own,\n'out comrades, it is really better '\nto hawk one\u2019s own wares and If\nthey are good, they will find a\nbuyer on their own.\n1 \u201cSo when our enemies try to\nbring us into conflict\u2019 over which\nIs Yhe best method of socialism,\nI we reject this. It is not in the\n1 interests of socialism.\n\u201cWe are above all internation\nalists. Comrades, Poles, com\nrades, brothers, never desert us\n\u2022 and .we will never desert you,\n: never, never, never,\ni \u201cAs If we were trying to ex\n> tract some material advantage\n: from friendship with these coun\njtries!\n\u201cAre we invalids that we can\u2019t\nlook after our own country?\ni There have been some stupid*\n; ities, but this is all in the past.\n'I welcome Comrade Gomulka. I\ni welcome him wi' all my heart.\n, ; May his leadership strengthen.\n- We shall do everything to sup\n\u2022 port him. but I think the Polish\nI people will do it themselves.\u201d\nEban Rejects\nRestoration of\nOld Conditions\nIsraeli Ambassador Abba Eban\nsays \u201cnothing could be more sui\ncidal\u201d for his country than a re\nturn to conditions which existed\nbefore Israel\u2019s attack on Egypt.

A land where every man has a chance to\nbecome independently wealthy if he has the ability, the\nenergy and the initiative.\nIn no industry in the world has the spirit of competi\ntion been more exemplified than in the automotive indus\ntry, which ever since its birth, has set the production\npace for world industry. In foreign countries, it is the\nmarvel industry'of all time.\nEngland, Germany and France all had the opportunity of\nbeing the automotive producing nations of the world. But\ntheir political economy was not equal to the job.\nSocialism of the type that is woven into the political stric\ntures of those countries is synonomous with industrial stag\nnation. And that is what Senators Wagner and Murray are\nattempting to sell this country for postwar.\nIt isn\u2019t sufficient that the Wagner bill already has sold\nus a heritage of legalized racketeering in the formation of\nour present labor laws, where the power of law is directed\nto \u201cprotecting\u201d only the labor side of the triumvirate that\nbuilds great industries: labor, capital and management.\nIt isn\u2019t enough that we have already enacted legislation\nthat stifles all incentive among those who work for a living\nthe pay or earnings of the expert workmen to a\nthat of the average, and makes it obligatory for\nall and non-government body for\nthe privilege and holding a job.\nIt isn\u2019t enough thatHStewatfirWagner and his ilk in the\nNew Deal have endeavored to Is*'piit s management and capi\ntal in such ill repute in the eyes of jurisdic\ntional fights between racketeering groups orttmtaiists have\nbeen allowed to go on during wartime when the\nence of our nation was in the balance.\nNow, as Paul Mallon says , \u201cThat a whole national\neconomy, a whole political system, should be turned over\nand destroyed to give them (the lazy, shiftless and in\ncompetents) jobs\u2014that the interests of 3,000,000 people\nshould prevail above 130,000,000 \u2014is absurd\u201d\nBut, unless some spark of sanity is injected into our politi\ncal economy and some party strong in its desire to preserve\nAmerica for those who wish to work freely and for advance\nment, doesn\u2019t appear soon, it looks as if America the\ngreatest industrial nation in the world, a nation where com\npetition developed inoentive and salesmanship to its highest\ndegree and created desires, machines and jobs is headed\nfor industrial stagnation.\nWaeklaatoo\nChandler Bldg\nNational 4303\n( UeAft\n3SO N.

Do you recall that\nit was just before the Nazi sur\nrender that our airmen were won\ndering what had happened to the\nLuftwaffe? Personally 1 am expect\ning some big news any day now,\nand I presume you are, too!\n* * a\nIt is Interesting to contemplate\nfor a minute what would happen\nif we should read in next Monday\u2019*,\npaper that the Japs had capitu\nlated. We have already brought\nback to the United States for re\ndeployment more than a half mil\nlion American soldiers who are\nheaded across country to the Jap\nwar. Certainly if surrender came\nnow they could not be moved fur\nther and there would be a great\nhowl set up rightfully to allow\nthese hoys to get out of uniform\nand back to their farm and factory\njobs. Already we have seen how\nquickly our men can be brought\nLack from the four corners of the\nearth and what stupendous prob\nlems we will have in reconverting\nthem to civilian life and giving\nthem employment.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWhen our factories were asked to\nconvert to war production follow\ning Pearl Harbor, every facility of\nevery government department wtfs\ngiven them freely. Procurement of\nthe necessary machinery and ma\nterials for getting under way pro\nduction of arms and ammunition\nwas speeded up by cutting red tape\nand ruthlessly eliminating any ob\nstacle that stood in the way of con\nversion. It is perfectly obvious to\nme, even from the sidelines, that\nthere is no such attempt to speed\nreconversion being made by these\nsame government bureaus today.\nDetroit is rife with stories of de\nlays, bungling of procurement or\nders, standing in line behind orders\ntor machine tools for foreign gov\nernments who are still getting de\nliveries under our Lend-Lease pro\ngram. The men in this automotive\nindustry are doing everything in\ntheir power, and against great odds,\nto reconvert their plants to make\npossible the minimum quotas of\ncars and trucks which the govern\nment has allowed for the balance of\nthis year. It might be well for you*\nto write your senator or congress\nmen asking if they are doing every\nthing they can to cut this govern\nment red tape.\n\u2022 * *\nThere have been rumors in De\ntroit for weeks that Canada would\nabandon its gasoline and oil ra\ntioning on Aug. 1 and at the same\ntime clamp down on civilian rail\nway transportation. The two an\nnouncements were to come simul\ntaneously, and we wanted to he the\nfirst to give Canada a loud cheer\nfor thus happily solving its trans\nportation problem between military\nneeds and civilian necessities.\n\u2022 * A\n...

He said \"no\none can deny its impact on power\ndevelopment, but it is as much a mat\nter of controversy today as it was 50\nyears ago.\" He maintained the pref\nerence clause should apply only when\n''all other factors are equal\", and\n\"as a matter of principle\", he said,\n\"I do not believe our government can\never be justified in giving preference\nto one class of people over another.\nThis principle is wrong,\" he said.\nThe power company attorney said\nthe preference clause gives prefer\nence to public agencies and co-ops fi\nnanced by public money. He added\nthe present administration has repud\niated that policy. He said federal pow\nshould be on a \"come and get it\nbasis.\"\nHe said the preference clause is\nnot justified as an anti-monopoly pro\nvision, because in practice it has been\nused in many instances to force many\nareas into public ownership to build\npublic monopoly ... if only the\nfederal government is allowed to\nbuild dams, he said, \"it is as plain as\nthe nose on your face that there will\nbe nothing left for the private com\non\ner\n:\npanies to distribute.\"\nHe concluded the preference clause\ndid not tend to solve a problem but\nto socialize an industry.\nLawrence Potamkin, attorney for\nNational Rural Electric Co-op Ass'n.,\nWashington, D.

Public bodies and co-opera\ntives can not buy \"secondary power\"\nwhich is cheaper, so in the long run\nco-operatives pay a higher price than\ncommercial companies.\n\"The government makes its assets\navailable to the use of the people\",\nsaid Potamkin, 'the government is\nthe people, what the government\nthe people own, what the gov\nowns\neminent owns at all times should be\nused for the benefit of the people,\nthe government owns these facilities\nonly as trustees for the people, and\nthe facilities must not be made avail\nable only through a profit making or\nganization\u2014a third party who will\nadd his profit before selling the pow\ner back to <-the owner.\n\u00bb\n\"Preference is nothing more\nless than recognition of the rights\nof an owner to use its own product\n\u2014nothing more than the people\ndoing as a group what they can\nnot do individually.\"\nThe NRECA attorney said it is the\nfunction of our government to use\nthe natural resources for the benefit\nof the people\u2014people living where\nthey are will get the first and most\nbenefit from them\u2014it ghould not be\nor\nHe spoke of the good and the dis\nI\ndenied to them.\naster possible from our natural re\nsources and pointed out that the\nopposition to federal power facilities\nnever questions the government build\ning dams for flood control. In other\nwords, he said, the test has not been\non whether the benefit is for the\nmany or a few. Because some can\nnot use the federal power and some\ncan use it it should not be denied to\nthose who can. The preference clause\nis only a preference statement that\nsays in the final analysis the people\nare the owners, based on the ele\nmental philosophy of our country.\nPOWER COMPANIES NOT\nFREE ENTERPRISES\nPotamkin says \"private companies\nsay the preference clause is harmful\nto its customers and its companies.\nFull competition is our free enter\nprise system. Power companies are\nnot part of the free enterprise econ\nomy, there is no connection with any\nother free enterprise business. This\nthey can not have. By being a monop\noly they lose their rights to the free\nenterprise privileges.\nIs any government activity a\n'form of socialism? Public schools,\ncity water, sewerage systems, postal\nsystem? The socialism issue doesn't\nexist. The tax issue doesn't exist,\neither. Since they do not pay taxes\n. . . They question the entire gov\nernment system. Unless they are\nready to propose an entire new sys\ntem of government they might as\nwell stop singling out the power\nfield for attack, he asserted.\n' '\nBecause the taxes they collect are\nno benefit for the customer, Potam\nkin asked, \"Could it be the real rea\nson is that the power companies would\nlike to eliminate these municipalities\nand co-operatives?\" \"The destruc\ntion of the preference clause would\nbe the most important single step\nin the elimination of these people,\nit would mean complete monopoly,\nhigher pi-ices and poorer sex-vices,\" he\nadded.\nThe preference clause means the\nright of the people to serve them\nselves through their government and\ntheir own facilities. If these facilities\nwere given to the private utilities\nthey would make you pay a toll to\nyour private utility on your own in\nstallation. If private utilities give\nthe best service at the lowest cost\nthen they have no fear of their fu\nture. If they fail to do that they in\nvite disaster, Potamkin said.\nHe concluded, many small co\noperatives would not exist without\nthe preference clause and there\nwould still be many rural people\nwithout electricity.\nThe arguments of the private pow\ner companies were the same from all\nspeakers who, besides Mr. Hill were\nEdwin Vennard, vice president and\nmanaging director, Edison Electric\nInstitute, and A. J. G. Priest, former\ngenex-al counsel for Electric Bond\nand Share, and Idaho Power Co., New\nYork, and px-esently Dean of Law at\nVirginia Univex-sity.\nThey argued that they spoke for\nthe 80% of the people of the nation\nwho are serviced for power from pri\nvate utilities. They contend all of\nthe people of the nation should not\npay for power facilities for the 20%\nof our citizens who benefit from the\npreference clause.\nThey admit the private utilities are\na monopoly and agree with everyone\nelse they can not be otherwise, but\nthey insist they are \"regulated\" by\nstate public service commissions and\ndeny heartily any charges that they\n\"regulate the regulators\".\nThe private monopoly speakers\nsaid, they 'do not pay taxes, but col\nlect them from the people, and add\nfor that reason the 80% of the people\nwho pay the taxes for the private\nutilities should not also have to pay,\nthrough their taxes for power for\nthe 20% who otherwise would not\nhave it.\nA. G. Priest spoke in scornful terms\nof the men who caused disrepute to\ncome to power monopolies in the days\nbefox-e public competition entered the\nfield, but announced firmly the vix-\ntues of present utilities people, when\nhe said, \"Time has run out on the\nevils of the utilities, and a number\nof years ago\u2014a man may turn from\nhis wickedness and live . . . there is\nnew attitude of electrical people.\n\u25a0 \u25a0\na\nThey said they fear the \"creeping\nsocialism\" of the present power dis\ntribution policy of the federal gov\nernment. They would debate socialism\nion its merits, but worry about what\nthey call the \"back door\" approach\nthey associate with the inclusion of\nthe preference clause in hydroelectric\nlaws of the nation.\nThey said they are for federal\ndams, if private utilities can not\nbuild them and sell the power as\ncheaply. They do not think REAs\nare socialistic, but they feel it is\nunjust, unfair and unequal for REAs\nand municipalities to have first Call\non the power generated at federal\ndams, and are in favor of the gov\nernment spending tax money to de\nvelop rivers and pay for effective\nflood control and prevention.\nLeland Olds, presently with Ener\ngy Research Associate, an affiliate\nof Public Affairs Institute and former\nchairman of the Federal Power Com\nmission, spoke on the preference\nclause as effective antimonopoly\nlegislation, saying the United States\nhas never found an effective way of\npreventing or controlling private\nmonopoly or monopolistic px-ice-fixing\nexcept through some foxm of public\nor co-operative competition because\ncommissions have become over the\npast 50 years more and more inclined\nto take the business or utility view of\nthings and all too frequently are used\nby the companies they are supposed\nto regulate.\nMr. Olds said, \"It is true that the\ncompetitive effect of the REA loan\nand assistance program, affording\nfarmers the opportunity to form rural\nelectric co-operatives, is primarily\nresponsible for raising the proportion\nof farms enjoying . . . electric serv\nice, from about 10% the year before\nthe REA program started to 95%\ntoday.

Where this com\npetitive influence was lacking the\nwholesale power rates forced on co\noperatives ranged from 0.9 to 1.5\nmills and, in most instances the state\nregulatory commissions were parties\nto the imposition of these burdensome\nrates.\"\nREAL AIM\u2014SKY-HIGH RATES\nHe said of the power companies,\nTheir drive to eliminate the pref\nerence provision is not aimed at get\nting low-cost power for their resi\ndential and rural customers but at\nforcing the public and co-operative\nsystems to buy through the toll-gates\nestablished by private monopoly\", and\nadded, \"the preference is not some\nthing to be considered alone, it is\npart of what makes it possible to have\npublic competition.\nOne of the most important parts\nplayed by the preference clause is\nnot a small savings to consumers\non their present limited use of elec\ntricity, but rather with breaking\nthe restriction of use which results\nfrom unnecessarily high rates\nlower rates simulate use.\nOlds spoke of the future for the\n4 .\n\u25a0 >\nAmerican family that is possible\nthrough the federal power program.\nLow cost power can increase the home\nuse for the country ten times and\nbring the American farm into its own\nperiod of automation.

In fact, the increasing\nmarket should provide sale for all\nthe milk.\nNow, lot us analize the gains or\nlosses to the withdrawing members\nin terms of dollars and cents. The\nreason given for the sale of milk\nto outside companies by these per\nsons was that the Co-op v/as not pay\ning enough in comparison with our\ncompetitor.Thn base price of our\ncompetitor was .,,11.00 per hundred\npounds of milk.

BENSON\nl : 'Q President of Harding College |\n|| SN |\n. Many socialist-minded Americans honestly believe that\n| \u201cdemocratic\u2019\u201d Socialism is a barrvier to Communism. Thus\n!Iha\\' carnestly work for a gradual socializing of the Amey\n[ican cconomic system. Usually these people are idealistice\nand their political and economic opinions are based on the\n[ theories of present-day \u2018\u201c*social thinkers\u201d as presented in\nbeoks and from lecture platforms. They haven't had any\n| actual experience with Socialism in action. _ |\n1 Sober-thinking people interested in the difference be\n| tween Socialism and Communism should read two signifi\nt cant books, one by Ivor Thomas, an idealistic Englishman |\n]\\\\'hn. as a member of Parliament, actually helped establish\ni.\\'uci:tli,\\'m in England; and the other by John \u2018Strachey, |\ni powerful Minister of War in England\u2019s Labour-Socialist\n{ government under Mr. Atlee,\ni John Strachey wrote in his book, \u201cThe Theory and Prac-\nI tice of Socialism:\" \u201cIt is impossible to establish communism\n| as the immediate successor to capitalism. It is, accordingly,\nCproposed to establish socialism as something which we can\n[ put in the place of our present decaying capitalism. Hence\n| Communists work for the establishment of socialism as a\nnecessary transition stage on the road to communism.\u201d Stra\ni chey described himself as a Marxist Socialist, Thus he speaks\n| for both Socialism and Communism.\n\u2018 Ivor Thomas speaks as a lover of freedom and a political\ntdo-gooder, but one who has gained wisdom through experi\nence. In his book, \u201cThe Socialist Tragedy,\u201d he warns people\n| everywhere that he knows now, after seeing Socialism in\n{ practice in England, that any departure from private en\ntterprise and toward Socialism is a step toward the police\n| state of Communism. |\n' \u201cWhere there has been a decisive test,\u201d notes Thomas,\n| \u201cthe history of Europe provides no confirmation of the view\nIlhut socialism can be an effective barrier to communism.\n{ On the contrary, the experience of many countries is that\n{ socialism has prepared the way for communism.\u201d\nf As regards Britain\u2019s Labour-Socialist Party Ivor Thomas\ni cites its own 1948 platform to show that it has grown from\n| a \u201csocial democratic\u201d movement to a zealous toliower of Karl\n! Marx.\n\u2018 \u201cIn its acceptance of the Marxist outlook and program,\nj the Labour Party,\u201d he says, \u201chas passed the \u2018point of no re\n{ turn.\u201d There can be no going back to social democracy. The\n| party can only go on relentlessly to communism.\u201d\nRy KIS bon A AS S T L O e S S L o o 0 SY (R\n'Senator Friend Gives\npE :\nOpinion on Lake Site\ni\n| To the Citizens of Garrett County:\n\u00a9 I have just introduced a bill\n{ authorizing our County Commis\n{ sioners to grant exemption from\ni local taxes for a period up to t,-n\u2019\ni years on new husiness coming into\n1 our county, providing they can give\n| assurances of reasonably steady\n| emplovyment to twenty-five men or:\nL over.

They buy land :nulf\n{ build homes that will yield taxes,|\n\u2018| and thus, they are kelping to share |\n\u2019mn- burdens, They do not ask for\nlanything but privacy; they don't|\ny expect anything from us other than|\n| decent treatment. They pay taxes |\n- but get very little if anything in|\njreturn, They have no children to|\n| crowd our schools and add to our)\n| burdens, They are law abiding and |\ni:hvrvt'nw add no burdens thmu_;:h!\n[ law enforcement.

They contribute |\n~ to our churches and make at least}\n;fsnmu employment for caretakers\n| during their long absence th\u2019ruu}.rh'\ni the winter. |\n! The employment created through\n[ the construction of their homes,\n| the profits of the groceryman and\n;!l}\u201c\u2019 garage man, the taxes they\n| pay into our treasury are all clear\ncain,\n] - . .\nIf we treat them right, they will\n| stay and bring their friends who\n{may also invest with us, If we\n(abuse them, we will lose them and\n| our potential investors also. Make\n\u2018ino mistake about it, these people\n| are not going to suffer abuse from\n|our county officials nor from our\ncounty press, There are many other\nplaces and many other states where\nthe welcoming hand of friendship\nand appreciation are always out,\nto the retired, or still busy citizen\nwho has the money to pay his way,\nllf we fail to understand this and\nact upon it now, the loss will be\n| ours, and it will be a tragic loss.\n; Now regarding the proposed\npark on the Lake, nobody ils trying\nlto stop it, and nobody that I}\n|| know anything about is opposing\nlit. I have asked the Forestry Dc-|\n| partment to make the park an as\n[ set to us rather than another lia-|\nbility. Unfortunately they are prn-l\n| posing to take private land by con-|\n1 demnation from the very place\n| where it would do most harm, The\ntract of land the Forestry Depart-l\n| ment is trying to take lends itself |\n| to isolation and privacy. This is not |\n| a desirable feature for any public:\n| park. Because that wooded land is|\nso isolated is the reason why SU}\n| many busy professional men have!\n| chosen that side of the Lake furl\n| their recreation and retirement\n.| homes. They bought and built thur(-l\n| with the one purpose in view of|\n| being a little way off the beaten!\ntrack. Many of them have plans]|\n|| for bringing their friends and zls-|\n| sociates, and getting them also to\nbuild. The people who are alr(-ad_v|\n| there are our very best salesmen\nfor our future growth. The entirel\ntract of land that the I)(-partmcnti\nwants has been laid out for private!\ndevelopment. There are almost al\nhundred valuable homesites within\nthe area the Department is plan\n| ning to take.\ni The home owners who came-and|\ninvested there, thinking they would |\nfind privacy and rest, are now be-|\n.| ing told that their private interestsl\n| are not worthy of any consider-|\nation, They have been attacked by |\nour local paper merely hecause |\n'they have asked that the proposed'\nTHE REPUBLICAN.

I have asked that\nfurther search he made with a view\nto finding a location for the park\nthat would be less objectionable,\n|!~\u2018nn_\\'-.m- property owners from\nthat side of the lake have signed a\npetition asking that the park be\nlocated at some other point, I be\n:liove that we ought to give con\nsideration to their pleas. A park\nhere would truly stunt the future\ngrowth of that area.

If the\n| land is taken by the Forestry De\nlp:n-tnu-nt that potential will be\n| gone forever. Already the Forestry\nDepartment and the Game Depart\n! ment have one-fourth of our county\n| under their ownership or control.\n| Surely we do not have to take ad\ni ditional private land that is so\n| valuable for future growth. Sure\n-Iy, we do not have to break faith\n' with our investors and destroy con\ni fidence by refusing to give con\n' sideration to their petitions.\ni Furthermore, private property\n' should be taken by condemnation\n| gt SE e B 1 Lan\n| only when it is clearly needed fo\n| the public welfare, With one-fourth\n| of the land in our county already\n| under the control of the State For\nt('stry Department, including sev\n| eral thousand feet of lake frontage,\n|it is unlikely that the public wel\n| fare will be better served by add-\nI ing this particular tract of land to\ntheir already vast domain. Under\nprivate development this tract of\n| land will yield many thousands of\ndollars each year that will be paid\ninto our county treasury. If the\nState does take it for public\n. B\nuse, that potential revenue will be\ndried up forever,\nFinally, it would be inconsistent\nto offer tax exemptions in an ef\nfort to attract new business and\ninvestment into our county on the\none hand while on the other hand,\nwe are frightening investors away\nby allowing the Forestry Depart\nment to condemn investment prop\nerty that is known to be desirable\nfor the purpose of attracting more\ninvestors into our Countv,\n.

Several\n| skirmishes have been fought and\n1 a few experiments, mostly in small\n! concerns, made.

The atminmentl\n\u2019nf this objective is their main goal\nifor 1955\u2014and nothing less than\nthis will satisfy them, At least that\nlis the CIO view.

We cannot\nfight effectively against an enemy\nwithin or without if our society is\nconstantly torn with bitter inter\nnal strife, one group against an\nother. Under such conditions our\neconomic progress slows down\nand the moral character of our\nr nation is weakened.\nOne of the worst blights in\nAmerica today is the conflict\nwhich propagandists have built up\nbetween employers and employ\nees. This war of group against\ngroup is actively agitated by Com\nmunists and other radical ele\nments working for a \u201cNew Social\nOrder.\u201d But the Socialists and\nCommunists couldn\u2019t successfully\ncreate enduring strife between\nthese important groups in our\nAmerican population if both\ngroups had a knowledge of basic\nsound economics and real social\njustice.\nThe true interests of both laoor\nand management are identical.\nEmployees of a business or indus\ntry always have a moral right to\nrequest an increase in pay when\nthere is increased productivity for\nwhich they are directly responsi\nble. Social justice gives them the\nright to request it, though not to\nforce it. Under the capitalistic\nprinciples of private property and\nfree enterprise no minority group\nhas a right to take by force the\nwealth of another, or in effect im\npose taxes upon others.\nWage raise requests are just,\ntherefore, when the employees\nhave themselves helped to boost\nproductivity and, thus, company\nincome. Though social justice may\nin some instances decree that\nthey be given a share of profits or\nwealth they didn\u2019t help create,\nthey have no moral right to de\nmand that. The Socialist doctrine,\non the other hand, does not recog\nnize the principle of private prop\nerty. It gives everybody the right,\nby force of law, to participate in\nthe fruits of the production of ev\nerybody else. That is the essence\nof Socialism.\nPeople who invest their savings\ntcapital) in the establishment and\noperation of a business have the\nright, under the American sys\ntem, to keep the profit. The only\nmoral obligation on them is to ac\ncord just treatment to the employ\nees and the public. Social justice\ndecrees, further, that they reward\nthe employees properly for in\ncreased productivity. But to do or\nnot to do this is a prerogative of\nhuman rights. When, or if, an at\ntempt is made to establish this\neconomically and socially sound\ncode by force of law\u2014or by any\nforce\u2014real social justice is there\nupon violated.\nTherefore, the demand of So\ncialist or Communist propagan\ndists for a share in the profits of\na business solely on the basis of\ntheir so-called \u2018Social Justice\u201d or\n\u201cEconomic Democracy,\u201d and ig\nnoring the fundamental rights of\nthe business ownership, can never\nbe harmonized with the philoso\nphy of American capitalism or\nreal human justice. These are fun\ndamentals: U) The enforced shar\ning of wealth is Socialism regard\nless of what label it may be given.\n<2\u00bb The voluntary sharing of\nwealth is an American capitalist\n(and Christian) ideal which has\nbeen liberally exercised. (3) And\nreward measured upon the base\nof productivity is economically\nand morally sound.\nDave Beck, leader of the Inter\nnational Brotherhood of Team\nsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen\nand Helpers of America, said in a\nspeech: \u201cThere is no problem to\nhuman relationships so complex\nor so grievous that it cannot be\nsolved reasonably, if men of char\nacter, men with a sincere desire\nto cooperate in mutual confidence,\nwill sit down together around the\nconference table, each respecting\nthe rights and dignity of the other,\nand all inspired by the will to\nserve the common good.\u201d\nThat\u2019s a good statement. It is in\ncontrast to one made a few weeks\nlater by Emil Mazey, secretary\ntreasurer of the United Automo\nbile Workers, in a speech to\nChrysler strikers. He was quoted\nas saying: \u201cWhen we grow a little\nstronger we will demand all that\nwe produce.\u201d This goal ignores\nthe \u201crights and dignity\u201d of the in\nvestors who build the plants and\nfinance purchase of the machin\nery, raw materials and manageri\nal skill to provide the jobs.

But there is grave danger in the bit by\nbit growth of Socialism under some other label, warns Dr.\nCeorge S. Benson, president of the National Education pro\ngram,\nSocialism that now largely dominates the Scandinavian\ncountries, was identified as government aid programs, welfare\nstate measures. Many European nations now are so deeply\ncnmeshed in it they never throw it off. And Socialism\nc\u00a2ots worse, not better, as it evolves toward the totalitarian\npoiice state.\nIn America we face the danger that Socialism\u2014big\npowerful central government\u2014will gradually take over un\nder the guise of social welfare or some other label.\nSocial security keeps going up and including more people,\nat the same time costing taxpayers more. Welfare programs\ncontinue to expand, and federal care for various classes of\npeople is indicated. Federal aid schemes are advanced, all\naimed at giving some class a break, In reality they are just\nsaddling a heavier burden on the citizens.\nDr. Benson mentioned a study of voting records of\nSenators and Congressmen, analyzing all the votes of every\nSenator and every Representative for several years. The\nanalysis is not based on whether or not the vote was for or\navainst \u201cagriculture,\u201d \u201clabor,\u201d \u201cbig Business,\u201d or \u2018\u2018Federal\nAid,\u201d or any other category of legislation, but how the vote\natfected fundamental principles of traditional American gov\nernment ; what it did to Liberty for all Americans. The study\nshows whether these legislators voted to adopt more Social\nism or tended to continue the kind of American political and\ncconomic system which has been the envy of the world for\nmore than a century.\nThe results are showing that most of them are wittingly\nor unwittingly voting to dilute the fundamental American\nprinciples and replace them with the doctrines and functions\nof Socialism. The vote shows\u2014mnot that they necessarily\nwant to establish Socialism here but that they have been\nundermining constitutional principles and are carrying\nAmerica further into Socialism,\nThere ought to be a general reappraisal of whither are\nwe going!\n4-H\u2019ers In Contest\nto Improve Entrances\nFour-H Entrance Improvement\ncontest winners were announced by\nRoger Roderick, Vice-President of\nthe 4-H County Council on June\n24 preceding campfire activities at\nthe Western Maryland 4-H Center.\nWinners of the Family class are\nPat, Karen, Mary Shawley, Bit\ntinger: Boys' Class\u2014Larry Tichnell,\nRyans Glade; Girls\u2019 Class\u2014Dotty\nHetrick, Bittinger.

Nor is\nthere any justification before the\nworld for the organization of a\nNorth Atlantic alliance inside the\nUnited Nations unless some one\nnation or group of nations dis\nplays signs of aggressor tactics.\nIt would seem natural for the\nSoviets, therefore, to lift the\nblockade of Berlin and eliminate\nthe biggest black mark on their\nrecord, while at the same time\nmaking a propaganda drive about\ntheir desire to preserve peace. j\nIf Moscow should decide on such\na course, it might or might not\nlessen the activities of the West\nern powers by way of military\npreparation, but it would certainly\ngive the Russians an advantage in\nthe court of public opinion. They\nwould continue to accuse the\nWestern Allies of organizing mili\ntary alliances while there is no\nsign of aggressor action on the\nhorizon. To back up such a claim,\nthe Russians can be expected to\nurge that all occupying forces be\nwithdrawn from Germany.\nCan Afford Move.\nThe Russians can afford to make\nsuch a move If they have secretly\ndecided to prolong the stalemate\nthat exists between them and the\nWestern Allies.\nIf the assumption that Russia ,\nmeans to go to war in the next:\nfew years be dispelled by her own\nactions in diminishing her mili\ntary operations in Europe, then\nthe alternative policy\u2014a refusal\nto agree to Allied demands and\nproposals and the continuance in\nstead of a program of aloofness\u2014\nwould seem to be the calculated\ndetermination the Russians may\nwell have reached.\nAs long as America is kept bur\ndened with expenditures of $15\nbillion a year for Marshall Plan\naid. the Russians may well be-|\nlieve that the American economy j\nwill be strained to the breaking\npoint.

When the\nfirst peace treaties were concluded\nin 1946 the British and American\ngovernments showed a complete\nlack of interest in that little Nor\ndic republic and, without admit\nting in so many words, accepted\nthe fact that Finland was within\nthe Soviet sphere of influence.\nTactics in Finland.\nIn recent months, however, Mos\ncow has become displeased with\nthe relative independence of the\nHelsinki government and has been\nclosing in ever since by demanding\nthat the present government,\nheaded by Prime Minister Fager\nholm, be replaced by a 100 per\ncent Communist administration.\nAmerican and Western Euro\npean observers believe that within\na short time after the Atlantic\npact is ratified there will be a\n\u201cbloodless\u201d coup in Helsinki.\nFinland, not being a member of\nthe United Nations, has less\nchance than Iran had in 1946 to\nappeal to that body, particularly if\nMoscow insists that its actions are\nan internal affair, concerning the\nFinnish \u201cdemocrats\u201d alone.\nWhether the Kremlin will de\ncide. in the new conditions cre\nated by the Atlantic Pact, to take\nmore positive action in Iran is a\nhighly speculative matter.

It\nis \"soft social\nism.\u201d\nThe financier\nis Thomas S.\nHolden, presi\ndent of the F.\nW. Dodge Corp.\nHe has written\na pamphlet en\ntitled, \"Housing\nDictator\nship and Soft\nSocialism,\u201d and\nLovell Mellett.\nit is now being distributed by the\nCommerce and Industry Associ\nation of New York. It reaches\nWashington in time to prevent the j\nthreatened dictatorship, if enough,\nmembers of Congress are persuad-1\ned to share the fears of Mr.\nHolden and the Commerce and\nIndustry Association. The im- j\nmediate threat, as Mr. Holden secs!\nit, is contained in the public hous- i\ning legislation which is about due\nfor action in the Senate.\nHe Worked It Out.\nMr. Holden\u2019s explanation of how\nhe worked out the name follow s:!\n\"This proposal is part of a\nstandard pattern evolved by the;\nbureaucracies of Europe and of\nthe United States and of official\ninternational bodies. It is a pat\ntern that presidents and prime\nministers and legislative repre\nsentatives of the people seem\neager to indorse or powerless to\nresist. It is not the standard Karl\nMarx brand of socialism, but a\nvariant of it. Here in the United\nStates it has been called planned\neconomy, the social welfare state,\nand an undefined American form\nof statism.\n\u201cPerhaps the best name for it\nIs soft socialism, in contrast to\nthe tough socialism of. the Nasls\nand Communists.\u201d\nAccompanying the pamphlet Is\na letter from Thomas Jefferson\nMiley, executive vice president of\nthe Commerce and Industry As\nsociatipn. Says Mr. Miley:\n\u201cThe proposed Federal Housing\nAct of 1949 (S. 1070) Is a social\nistic rehash of the infamous and\nthrice-doomed Wagner-Ellender\nTaft bill of recent years.\n\u201cMr. Holden\u2019s analysis of It Is\nbased on an intimate knowledge\nof the building industry, the pub\nlic housing movement here and\nabroad, and of the economic,\npolitical and social implications\ninvolved in the Federal dictator\nship over an important sector of\nour economy.\u201d\nSenator Taft should find Inter\nest in that description of the\nlegislation wrought largely out of\nhis own blood, sweat and tears. .\nSoft or Otherwise.\nThe board of directors of the\nCommerce and Industry Associa\ntion. whose names appear on the\nletterhead, should find interesting\nthe views put out under the\norganization\u2019s imprint. Among\nthem are the heads of a number\nof the country\u2019s biggest banking,\nmanufacturing, shipping, aviation,\nrailroad, oil and utility concerns.\nMost, if not all, of these concerns\nare prospering mightily these\ndays, but they may be just as\nbadly scared as Mr. Holden. Some\nof them may realize that the ter\nrible tendencies of the Govern\nment in recent years have helped\nproduce the prosperity they now\nenjoy. They may think, however,\nthat it is all right for the Govern\nment to aid the shipping lines,\nthe railroads and the airlines, that\nisn\u2019t socialism. Nor is it socialism\nto make the banking business as\nnearly fool-proof as possible. It\nonly becomes socialism when the\nGovernment undertakes to help\nthe people directly.\nAs Mr. Holden says, \u201cThe Fed\neral Government,, through the\ncreation of the home loan bank\nsystem and the mortgage insuring\nsystem of FHA, has created aj\nmodern home financing system j\navailable to those potential home'\nowners who desire to use the\nfacilities offered. This is essen\ntially banking legislation, sound in\nprinciple, but in no sense imply\ning an obligation to supply hous\ning. It has made it easier for\npeople to secure adequate hous\ning for themselves.\u201d\nBut some cynical citizens might\nsay it has made it possible for the\nbanks to lend money at satisfac\ntory interest rates while passing\non the greater part of the risk to\nthe Government, and such citizens\nmight consider that little different\nfrom socialism, soft or otherwise.\nBRAKES RELINED\nWHILE YOU WAIT\nFORD (Hyd.) \u00bb OLDS \u00abj \u00ab\nPLYMOUTH $Q'50 PONTIAC $11.50\nCHEVROLET 9 KSsE. \u00ab * '\nFree Adjustments for Life of Linings\u2014Duplicate D.

Instead,\nhe will devote\nhimself to ac\ncomplishing as\nmuch as possi\nble of his pro\ngram while\nbuilding a rec\nord on which\nhe and his sup\nporters can\ncampaign in\n1950.\nThe new\nDorn Flreson.\nstrategy involves keeping the Sen\nate\u2019s nose to the grindstone, forc\ning it, if possible, to consider every\naspect of the Truman program.\nThe aim is a roll call on every\nthing so that each Senator can be\naccurately pinpointed when and\nas it is decided to fire at him.\nIt is entirely possible that the\ncountry will not again see a Tru\nman rampant until 1950. He has\nbeen assured that if he has kept\nus out of war and made a fight\ning record on other issues he will\nbe in a strong position to influ\nence the 1950 election.\nVinson Outlook Confirmed.\nChief Justice Vinson, an old\ncongressional hand, is credited\nwith cooling the President\u2019s im\nmediate frustrations and persuad\ning him to take the long view of\nthe problem that confronts him.\nThe Vinson outlook has been\nconfirmed by present develop\nments on the bill, where Senator\nTaft and Senator Russell, master\nminds of the South\u2019s successful\nfight on cloture, are united in an\neffort to cut ECA appropriations\n10 per cent. Senator Taft has de\nscribed this as \"a start.\u201d If it\nsucceeds\u2014and a close vote is ex\npected\u2014there are sure to be more\nof such efforts, perhaps a con\ntinuous 10 per cent warfare.

This does not\ninvolve any deep laid plots, it is\na natural understanding for a\nconservative coalition.\nThe senior Senators concerned\nwince at the general use of coali\ntion to describe their arrange\nments.

The Southerners still want\nto be Democrats at home and\nSenator Taft will minimize his\nSouthern ties when he runs again\nin Ohio next year.\nYoung Turks Uneasy.\nThe increasing identification of\nRepublicans with the South is\nalso a source of some uneasiness\nto Republican Young Turks, in\ncluding Senators Lodge of Massa\nchusetts and Ives of New York.\nA party record of that stamp will\ndo them no good in their States.\nAs they view the confused pic\nture with both parties split on\nalmost every major issue, the vet\nerans shake their heads. Party\nresponsibility is out the window\nfor this session, they predict, and\nthe going will be. rough all the j\nway.\nIn one sector President Truman\nis reported impatient and uncom\npromising. It is the question of\nhis palace guard and personal .ap\npointments. He is determined not\nto withdraw the nomination of\nMon Wallgren, disapproved by the\nArmed Services Committee, for\nchairman of the National Re\nsources Board.

Few of these are \u201copti\n' mistic.\u201d In fact,\nIf there is one\nquality that\ndisting u i s h e s\nthe best of\nmodern think\ning, It Is the\nrejection of the\nou 11 o o k that\ndominated the\nwhole of the\nnineteenth cen\ntury\u2014the idea\nof infinite prog\nress.\nOf these, the\nmost convinc\nDorotkr Thompion.\n| ing writer is Friedrich Georg\nIjuenger, whose \"The Failure of\nTechnology\u201d has been published\nby Regnery\u2014a small book of less\nthan 200 pages, which cannot,\nhowever, \"be read in an hour.\u201d\nAuthor Juenger sets out to\nj prove that modern technologies\n'are not a means to an end (hu\nman liberation), but have become\n| ends in themselves and are subor\ndinating every human purpose,\nthe unconscious realisation of\nwhich is the ground of modern\ndespair. The \"advanced\u201d world\nhas become a machine, with all\nlife and nature caught in its maw.\nDoes Not *8ave Labor.\u2019\nMechanism, he argues, is not\nproductive but voracious. It does\nnot \"save labor\u201d; it increases it.\nIt does not create wealth; it de\nvours like a vampire the resources\nof the earth. It does not abolish\npoverty; it universalizes it. And\nby the necessity of organization\nit creates vast bureaucracies of\nbusiness and government, increas\ning the number of unproductive\nworkers.\nPerhaps Juenger\u2019s most inter\nesting observation is that not the\nclass struggle is destroying \u201ccapi\ntalism.\u201d but technology, whose dy\nnamism tends to obliterate all\nconcepts of ownership. It destroys,\nfor instance, the value of money\nbecause its financial requirements\nsurpass all sound monetary sys\ntems.\nFar from bringing more leisure:\ninto human life, it drives men into\nperpetual motion, which is its\nnature and requirement, oven im\nposing on men abstract, mathe\nmatical \"time.\u201d to suit the effici\nency of the technological organ\nization, remote from human, or\nganic efficiency. This, he thinks,\ncreates the psychological insecur\nity characteristic of our life, a\ncraving (for security) which never\ncan be satisfied because tech\nnological organization is incom\npatible with Independence. i\nThe book was written before\nI the discovery of the process which\n! produced the atomic bomb, yet\nJuenger foresaw it. He could have\nused the perfection of the master\nweapon to comment on the\namoral nature of science. For not\n50 people in the world knew\nenough about atomic physics to\nproduce the bomb, and all of\nthese knew each other. Via neutral\ncountries they could have com\nmunicated with each other, in a\nsecret International pact, not to\ndevelop a weapon capable of de\nstroying the planet.\nPower Is End In Itself.\nBut, says Juenger, it is not the\nway of scientific technology to in\nquire into human ends. It is end\nin itself\u2014perpetual striving for\nsuperhuman power regardless of\norganic life.\nThe concept of the total state,\norganized on a completely tech\nnical basis, whether Nazi or Com\nmunist. always has attracted the\nscientific mind.\nBut. as Juenger observes, this\ndefinition annihilates the state,\nfor \"indispensable to the state is\nthat which is not state\u2014the peo\nple. \u2022 * \u2022 The technical organi\nzation of the whole people to the\npoint where no sector of life re\nmains unorganized \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 brings\nthe downfall of that state.\u201d\nThus, a keen modem mind\ncomes back to the Jeffersonian\nthesis, in which Jefferson himself\npredicted the state would not sur\nvive the immense centralization\nprocess accelerated by the ma\nchine.\n| (Released by The Bell Syndicate, Ine.)\nMcLemore\u2014\nDevises Language\nFor U.

As\nfor the women of 1999, they will \u201cstay young, beautiful\nand shapely indefinitely.\u201d\nWe have this on the authority of Dr. Lowry H.\nMcDaniel, of Tyronza, Ark., who made these revola\ntions to a convention session of the American Medical\nAssn, in Atlantic City. Even the common cold, he said,\n\u201cwill be only a memory.\u201d\nBut we think the good doctor might better have\ntold this to the Congress, so our law-makers can get\nbusy revamping the social security rules. If Americans\nin that day are still under wraps to quit work at 65,\nthey may be healthy, but they\u2019ll be a long time hungry.\nAnd what woman would cherish more or less eternal\nyouth, beauty and shapeliness if she couldn\u2019t even buy\na new hat?\nThere are those today who would feel young at 65\n\u2014if Uncle Sam would let them.\nA CONCRETE ANT HILL\nIf ants were provided with a concrete ant hill,\nwhat would they do? In all probability they would\nstart building a regular ant hill next to the concrete\none. Ants would perish without castles to build.\nSocialism is much like the hypothetical concrete\nant hill. It shouts Utopia and its sponsors promise a life\nof security. But it has in the past torn down the people\u2019s\naccumulated savings. What if socialism could give\ncradle to grave security? That alone would leave man\nas lost as the ant in a concrete hill.\n* A republic of free men is based on the premise that\nthe individual can build his own castle at his own risk\ninstead of living in a cubicle provided by the state. With\nincentive as an urge to produce, man pushes himself\nto t'he highest standard of living.\nThe energy of man must find an outlet in building,\nas much as the ant. The creative spirit cannot be static.\nBellingham, Wash., Herald: \u201cA suggestion that\nstockholders be guaranteed an annual dividend meets\nwith silence or chuckles, but a guaranteed annual wage,\nwhich must come from the same source, is presented as\na demand and considered seriously.\u201d\nTwo Young North Korean Fliers\nSurrender Yak Fighter To ROK\u2019s\nSEOUL, W\u2014Two young North\nKorean fliers buzzed the Seoul\nairport Tuesday in a old, Russian\nbuilt Yak fighter, then landed and\ngave themselves up to cheering\nSouth Korean airmen.\nThe two were marched to ROK\nair force headquarters for ques\ntioning. It was presumed they\nsought political asylum.\nSouth Korean officials identi\nfied the pilot as Capt. Lee Un\nYong, 24, who said he returned\nonly six months ago from a Rus\nsian jet flying school at Kiev.\nThe other flier was identified as\nLt. Lee Eun Song, 24, a navi\ngator trained in Red China. Both\nare natives of Pyongyang, the Red\nKorean capital.\nThey were the first Korean\nCommunist fliers to flee from the\nReds since Lt. Noh Kum Suk\nlanded a Mig jet fighter at near\nby Kimpo air field Sept. 21, 1953.\nHe received a $100,000 reward for\ndelivering the Mig and asylum in\nthe United States.\nROK officers said the two\nNorth Koreans crossed the truce\nzone at a hedge-hopping 50 feet\nto escape radar detection. Their\nplane, a Yak, is a single engine\npropellor driven fighter-bomber.\nThey said the control tower,\nmanned by Americans and Kor\neans, at first thought the Yak\n9\nwas a British plane. When the\nplane failed to answer a radio\ncall, a Korean noticed the Com\nmunist insignia.\nIt was given an immediate\n\u201ccome in\u201d signal.\nBrig. Gen. Kim Shun and other\nROK air officers met the Yak at\nthe end of the runway. The North\nKoreans told General Shin, \u201cWe\nwant to surrender.\u201d\nShin took the controls and\ntaxied the Yak to the apron where\na big crowd of Koreans and Am\nericans had gathered.\nComplications Beset\nSeward Dock Contracts\nWASHINGTON, MB\u2014'The Inter\nior Department said yesterday it\nhas under consideration 24 sets\nof bids by three construction out\nfits for the Seward dock project\nin Alaska.\nCongress voted $4,400,00 for the\nproject but officials said more\nthan one million of that already\nhas been spent for piling and\nother construction materials.\nOfficials told a reporter they\ndid not know when an award\nwould be made. They expressed\ndoubt it would be today as re\nported in some quarters.\nThe whole thing has now be\ncome very complicated, they said.\nHobby Disclaims\nResponsibility For\nVaccine Situation\nWASHINGTON, Uft \u2014Secretary\nof Welfare Hobby said Monday\nshe bears no responsibility for\nthe government\u2019s actions in the\nSalk polio vaccine situation. She\nsaid the law places tliat burden\non Surgeon General Leonard A.\nScheele.\nIn a radio interview, Mrs.\nHobby emphasized she was not\ndissatisfied with Scheele\u2019s actions.\nBut she made repeated distinc\ntions between the responsibilities\nof her department and those of\nthe Public Health Service, a\nWelfare Department agency head\ned by Scheele.\nAsked if she had any apologies\nfor the way the vaccine program\nhas been handled, or would, with\nhindsight have acted differently,\nMrs. Hobby said:\n\u201cThere is nothing I could have\ndone differently. The law (on\ncontrol of biologicals such as the\nSalk vaccine) charged the Public\nHealth Service and not the Sec\nretary.\u201d\nAt another point, she said she\nwould be legally powerless to\noverrule Scheele if she thought\nhe had made a mistake.\nLetter-Sixe File Folders For\nSale At The Nome Nugget Office.\n\u25a0Blfl.ummmt** 1 ill is ilitiiiii \u25a0' a\ni for one week only... a FREE I\nDUBARRY Make-Up Lesson\n*\nwith a DuBarry Beauty Expert direct from\nRichard Hudnut\nFifth Avenue Salon!

And it\u2019s probable\nthat few of us realize even now just how big a social\nistic businessman Uncle Sam has become.\nThe Chamber of Commerce of the United States\nmade a report on this matter. Here\u2019s an excerpt from\nit: \u201cToday our national government is, among other\nthings, the largest electric power producer in the\ncountry, the largest insurer, the largest lender, the\nlargest landlord, the largest tenant, the largest holder\nof grazing lands and of timberland, the largest owner\nof grain, the largest warehouse operator, the largest\nshipowner, and the largest truck fleet operator . . .\nGovernment comipoitition was reported by airlines,\nbakeries, cemeteries, coffee roasters, dry cleaners,\nfreight forwarders, motor vehicle repairers, ship build\ners, ship operators, retail grocers, rope manufacturers,\ntire retreaders, truckers, tug boat operators, warehouse\noperators, wooden box manufacturers and many\nothers.\u201d\nLIKE SCHOOL WITHOUT A TEACHER\nA small town without a newspaper would be like\nschool without a teacher or church without a pastor!\nThat striking opinion comes from Professor John\nH. Casey of the Department of Journalism of the Uni\nversity of Oklahoma. He went on to say this: \u201cIn the\naggregate, the country newspaper determines the out\ncome of more elections, exerts a greater influence\nfor constructive community progress, is read longer\nby more members of tjie family, and constitutes, with\nits millions' of circulation and quadrupled millions of\nreaders, a better advertising medium than any other\ngroup of newspapers or periodical publications.\n\u201cThrough service to its community, the country\nnewspaper will not merely survive; it will continue\nto flourish ...\u201d\nLovington, N.M., Leader: \u201cIf we would remain\nfree and enjoy rising living standards, it is time for all\nof us to realize the necessity of encouraging the saver\nand stimulating to greater efforts the few constructive\nmen and women among us who have the capacity\nendlessly to improve living standards for all of us.\u201d\nAlaska Airlines Makes Offer to\nMerge With Pacific Northern\nAmbassador Accuses\nSouth Korean Officials\nOf Misinforming People\nSEOUL, OR\u2014U. S. Ambassador\nEllis O. Briggs, in an unusual\npublic statement, Thursday in\neffect accused South Korean offi\ncials of misinforming their people\nconcerning the withdrawal of\nAmerican troops.\nCommenting on a demonstra\ntion of ROK war veterans before\nthe embassy Tuesday, Briggs de\nclared:\n\u201cWe can only conclude that\nthese demonstrators are misin\nformed on the issues involved in\nthe realignment of American forc\nes in the Far East and concerning\nthe measures being taken by the\nAmerican government for the\ncontinued defense of the repub\nlic . .\nPresident Svngman Rhee\u2019s gov\nernment has been highly critical\nof U.S. plans to withdraw four\ninfantry divisions and some air\nunits from Korea despite pledges\nof continued military and econ\nomic support.\n9 - Power Conference\nApproves Compromise\nTo Re-Arm Germany\nLONDON, OR\u2014A German\nspokesman announced Thursday\nthe 9-power conference on freeing\nand re-arming Germany has ap\nproved a compromise plan for\nestablishing and controlling a\nEuropean arms pool.\nThe plan, put forward by Bel\ngian Foreign Minister Paul-Henri\nSpaak, would divide responsibil\nity for safeguards on runaway\nGerman rearmament between a\nnew 7-nation European alliance\nand the North Atlantic treaty Or\nganization.\nThe German spokesman told\nnewsmen the Spaak compromise\n\u201cmet with the approval of Ger\nman Chancellor Konrad Adenauer\nand French Premier Mendes\nFrance and was also acceptable to\nthe other delegations.\nLegal Blanks ai The Nome Nuggel\n\u00bb WASHINGTON, GW\u2014Alaska Air\nlines has informed the Civil Aero\nnautics Board it has made an offer\nto acquire Pacific Northern Air\nlines.\nIt disclosed the offer in filing\na petition requesting a 10-day\npostponement of oral argument in\nthe CAB\u2019s proceeding on air ser\nvice between the United States\nand Alaska, pending develop\nments in the merger offer.\nOral argument on renewal of\nState-Alaska certificates of both\nairlines had been scheduled for\nOct. 12. However, the CAB was\ntold that officials of the two com\npanies will meet here Oct. 5 on\nthe merger offer.\nFrancis W. Brown, CAB chief\nexaminer, has recommended the\ntwo lines consolidate.

Del., under Act of March 3. 1879\nDELAWARE'S LEADING WEEKLY NEWSPAPER\nThe Milford Chronicle is Delaware's largest weekly\nnewspaper\u2014both in size of paper, number of pages printed,\nvolume of news carried, and lineage of advertising pre\nsented each issue. Ail advertising is sold on a basis of a\nguaranteed circulation of over 7,000 copies each issue.\nMEMBER OF THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\nThe Associated Press is entitled exclusively to the use\nfor republication of all the local news printed In this\nnewspaper, as well as all AP news dispatches.\nFRIDAY, MARCH 10, 1950\nINCOME TAXES BEGAN AS AN ACT\nOF POLITICAL REVENGE\nOf all the tremendous changes this coun\ntry has seen in the past half-century, neither\nthe aii-plane nor television\u2014not even atomic\nfission\u2014has proved as effective as taxes. The\nfederal government's share of the latest tax\nbill was 6I/2 times what the National Govern\nment spent in 1920.\nThe income tax originally was an act of\npolitical revenge and as a direct result of this\nact initiative and opportunity today are being\ntaxed out of existence.\nWhen the Democrats returned to\npower in 1892 Benton McMillin of Tennessee\nwas the ranking Democrat of the House Ways\nand Means Committee. As such, he rightful\nly expected to be made chairman. At the be\nhest of William C. Whitney and other rich\nNew York Democrats, Cleveland threw the\nchairmanship to William L. Wilson. McMillin\nthen tacked the original income-tax rider on\nto the Wilson Tariff Act of 1892 as a counter\npunch at Whitney and the others.\nEven as late as 1916, after the tax had\nbeen ruled out by the Supreme Court and re\nvived by Cordell Hull, only 430,000 Ameri\ncans had to pay, and then only 1% on net in\ncome after a $4,000 exemption.\nBut today, no American can make a\nsalary large enough to protect his future. No\ncompany can pay its chief load-carriers\nenough money to insure their futures. The\nmore they are paid, the greater the Govern\nment's slice, until the top-salaried man is\nworking nin \u00bb days for Uncle Sam, one for\nhis family.\nOur tax law's are defensible only on the\npremise that they mSTTe opportunity freer\nto all. They do the reverse. Ironically, these\nlaws favor the shrewd, the sharpie, the lucky,\nand the already well-heeled. The man of in\nborn acquisitive instinct still makes a fat\nliving. If he clears $100,000 on a deal, he is\nallowed to keep a pretty $75,000 under the\ncapital-gains clause, while those w-ho may\nearn $100,000 salary on sheer performance\nare subject to schedules running up to 91\nper cent.\nThomas Jefferson said, \"We must make\nour choice between economy and liberty, or\nprofusion and servitude. If w-e can prevent\nthe Government from wasting the labors of\nthe people, under the pretense of caring for\nthem, they w-ill lie happy.\nJefferson, patron saint of the\npresent wasteful National Administration,\nhad to say is just as true today as it was at\nthe time he spoke.\nFINANCING \"WELFARE\" AGENCIES\nFinancing \"welfare\" agencies out of treas\nury deficits is plain robbery. It manifests it\nself first in inflation and finally in economic\ncollapse. Unless a source of funds be found\nother than the empty treasury, chaos threat\nens.\nPerhaps there would be more employment\nat the moment were it not for the taxes pros\npective employers are required to pay. In\nthat event, the unemployment compensation\nhoax takes its place beside social security.\nGovernment control of industry, its re\nstraint of industry, its fixing of wages and\nhours, tend towards the destruction of\neconomic system, which is based upon the\nduty of every human being to render service\nin the field for which he is best adapted.\nour\nTHOSE POTATOES ARE MIGHTY HOT\nThere seems to have been'a slip in letting\nthe public in on the 45 million bushel potato\ndeal our Government must drop some place.\nThen there it a little something like a few\nTHOUSAND TONS of eggs stored in a lime\nstone cave near Atchison. Kansas.\nInstead of trying to kill communism with!\ndollars, why not refuse to give away dollans\nand substitute FOOD? It would be a lesson\nin being good neighbors and would eliminate\nthe bandit strategy of such holdup artists as\n( hiang-Kai-shek and the government of\nGreece.\nAnd it would save face for the Depart\nment of Agriculture. Those potatoes\ngetting mighty hot.\naie\nTHAT FEDERAL DEFICIT\n^ hen a village erects a municipal build\ning. even villager can know what the\ncon\ntrartor received, what wages he paid, and\nwhether he skimped on the plumbing. Such\nchecks are more remote and less effective\ncounty courthourse \u2014 still less so on a\nnew state capitol. At the Federal level, there\n\u00abMB only routine checkups. That's one rea\nI I wfa yTn de Sam is going into the red by\n95 1 -2 billion this year. Washington is trving\nto do too many jobs that ought to be super\nat the local level, and paid for by local\non\nIS SOCIALISM A \"SCARE WORD\"?\nPresident Truman drew his biggest laugh\nat the Lucullan Democratic Party banquet\nwhen he looked down on the fashionably\ndressed $100-a-plate diners and quipped\nsomething to the effect that nobody would\ntake them for socialists. Warmed by domes\ntic Burgundy, this appealed to the crowd as\na fine joke and there was vociferous applause.\nThey didn't feel that they looked like social\nists, because socialists ordinarily are visioned\nas lean and hungry people trying to persuade\nthe \"fatcats\" of the world to divvy up. How\never, no doubt there were some of those at\nthe affair who had been guests at Stalin ban\nquets where wine, or vodka, \"flowed like wa\nter,\" and who had reason to believe that the\ntop folk of any temporarily successful poli\ntical revolution are able to fare pretty well on\noccasion.\nThis, of course, is entirely aside from the\nquestion of whether the President made good\nin his effort to pooh-pooh the warning of the\nRepublicans that the New Deal and the Fair\nDeal are leading the nation down the road to\nSocialism. He said the Republicans have\nbeen trying such scare words as \"welfare\nstate and \"statism' 'and \"liberty or socialism\"\never since 1932. That is almost 20 years ago,\nwhich is a reminder that Karl Marx himself\nonce wrote, concerning his hoped-for \"revolu\ntion of the proletarit\" that,, \"In such great\ndevelopments, 20 years are but as a day \u2014\nand then may come days that are the concen\ntrated essence of 20 years,\" No one fears\nSocialism may come overnight.\nNo one knows what majority opinion in\nthe United States today is regarding the (\nclaim that we are drifting rapidly toward I\nsocialism, but people who fear so are noli\nwithout arguments.\nIn 1932, for example, there was no appre\nciable popular support for the Government\ngoing into the banking business, the money\nlending business, the financing business\npermanent basis and in direct competition\nwith private enterprise. Neither at that time\n, on a\nwould it have set well for any party to pro\nmise that they would give the country a per\nmanent policy of price support for agricul\nture, of permanently subsidizing the grower.\nYet the \"temporary\" mission of the R. F.\nC. has excused a $44,000,000 loan to an auto\nmobile company and a $37,000,000 loan to\nfabricated housing business, and the Admin\nistration is planning loans to \"small busi\nness.\" And the price support policy has re\nsulted in Government possession of millions\nof dollars worth of potatoes that it offers to\nsell back to the producers at a price of one\ncent per hundred pounds, while housewives\ncontinue to pay high prices for potatoes at\nthe corner grocery store.\nIt is the fact that \"temporary\" measures\ngive every evidence of becoming permanent\nthat worries thoughtful Americans. And\nthere wasn't one single word in the Presi\ndent's address that indicated any plan or\nwish for making \"temporary\" mean what it\nis supposed to mean.\na\nYOUR SHARE OF PUBLIC DEBT\nA recent statement of the Department of\nCommerce shows $273,600,000,000 outstand\ning public debt of national, state and local\ngovernments last year. That may not mean\nmuch to the average citizen until broken into\nper capita obligations. It means the average\nobligation for every man, woman and child\nin the United States last year was $1,694 for\nfederal debts, $113 for local government\ndebts and $27 for state debts.\nThese averages cover various states,\ncounties, cities and school districts, some of\nwhich have no debt at all and others with per\ncapital debts much higher. But the national\ndebt hits us all and is going higher because\nof deficit financing at Washington.\nBefore long, at the rate of\ncit by our Washington bureaucracy every\nman, woman and child in the United States\nwill be taxed every year to pay interest or\nprincipal an average of about $1,750 of the\ntotal national debt. Some taxpayA*s may\nhave the mistaken idea that the tax will not\nhit the average wage earner very hard but\nwill affect only the rich and the corporations.\nThe truth is that the heavy tax\nporations is passed along to every family as\nhidden taxes in higher prices to cover the\ncost of Government. And this is true of all\nother goods and services hit by huge income\ntaxes not paid directly by the individual tax\npayer. These hidden Federal taxes are esti\nmated at over $700 a year paid by the\nage family in addition to the deductions from\npayroll check and direct payments.\nIt might be a good idea to get out your\ntax bills and analyze them. Add $700 to your\nfederal income tax aid direct and by payroll\ndeductions, if you have an averaged sized\nfamily, and compare the total with what you\npay in local and state taxes. Then compare\nthe benefits you get from local government\nwith the direct benefits you get from th\nWashington bureaucracy. The results may\nbe surprising.\non cor\naver\n0\nTHAT LAW OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND\nWe can't see how Uncle Sam can pull him\nself up by the bootstraps and look forward\nto recovery from the present slump that our\nNation is suffering, simply by handing out\nGovernment money to boost the prices of all\nthe different kinds of food that people\naccustomed to eating. From time immemori\nal the prices on the merchants' shelves have\nbeen fixed according to the invisible device of\nsupply and demand. The stock and\nare\ng ram\nmarkets managed to boost the prices of food\nand other necessities of life pretty much as I\nthey pleased. But when the Fair Deal poli\nticians fro off on some other form of adven- !\nture the prices go down. Right now the Gov-j\nemment is-attempting to dictate and predict\nthe cost of all kinds of public necessities es\npecially crops, grains, fruits and vegetables\nthat come off the farms. There ar\u00e8 a lot of\nprescriptions offered by Congress about farm\nsecurity, but none of them, even though they\nmay have the approval of the ruler in the\n^ OUSe -'ii Seem ^ urn * s h any evidence\nmake the farmer successful\nHPR I , * I j j\ne IBM Ox supply and demand has bogged)\nown under the V eight of the \"Fair Deal.\" 1\n__________\nIN THE NICK OF TIME\nm\ns-u.\nE*\nfr\ni-'-\"\nTP\n\u25a0\nm\niV j\nV.\njy jm\n%-ftev\no\nw*\nT \u00c7AfN/A/G\nm & 9\nm\n/\u00c0\n/\n\u2022\u00bb***>,\nV\n\u2022sn.\n\u2022 \u2022 X...\n\\\n\u2022*v\nLi'\u00bb\n. *:*\n-V.\u00ce\nf-\u00ff\u00ee\u00bb 1\n<\u25a0>\nr.\n\u25a0s\nr *.\u00bb\n\u25a0 I\nwV\nVi\nr '\nThirty Years Ago\nAs Taken From The Files\nOf The Milford Chronicle\nMr. and Mrs. Pierce Marine ami\nlittle daughter, ( laia of Last\nOrange, N.

Statistics\nwill sho\\y that usually, men who\nsave a little every week from\ntheir school days on, will some\nday have an independent busi\nness of their own; while those who spend all they\nget. are always obliged to work for someone else.\nThe wife s part in this is also very important.\nAn old saying is that\nf\nW\nv \u2022\nV\nv\nJ\nI\nROGER W. BABSON\n'a woman can waste more at\nthe spigot than a man can pour into the bung hole.\"\n1 have graduated thousands of young men into busi\nness positions. Their success or failure has largely\nbeen determined by their spending habits, mostly\ndetermined by the wife.\nGOING INTO DEBT\nI believe that an enemy of thrift is \"Old Man\nLiquor;\" Not only do I believe that a large pro\nportion of the money spent thereon is wasted; but\nthat liquor is a cause of much crime and\npoverty.\nTo my mind a most foolish part of the liquor prob\nlem, is the\n.. wa y many young marired people spend\nmone y (,n \"social drinking.\" Readers may argue it\ndoes '' no harm,\" but i surely believe it usually is a\nwaete of money with which the family could buy\ns \u00b0methiing more useful. Many such families are\nalready in debt. This in my opinion is crazy finan\nc ' np: f\u00b0 r these families.\nEnemy No. 2 is the installment habit. The ex\nponents of tins habit claim \"it is forcing people to\nsave.\" Yet, it is far better to develop self-control\nand save money first and then buy what you want\nand get the 10% cash discount. Thus, my advice to\nyoung people with ambition is to keep away both\nfrom social drinking and installment buying. It is\neasy to become a slave to either; but it is hard\nlater to get free from either. Salesmen want you to\nbuy on the installment plan because it is so highly\nprofitable to them.

Milford, Delaware _\nat Milford Postofflce as second class mall matter\nFRIDAY, OCTOBER 10, 1947\n. .\nford Chronicle entered its 70th year of ser\nvice to the citizens of Milford, Kent and Sus\nWITH LAST WEEK'S ISSUE, the Mil\nta\nsex Counties and the State of Delaware.\nFrom the time of its first issue on October 4,\n1878 to the present, the publishers of the\nChronicle have endeavored to give Delaware\nan outstanding weekly newspaper\u2014one of\nwhich residents of Milford can be justly\nproud. Long a leader among Delaware week\nlies, the Chronicle has won national recogni\ntion time after time. It is recognized nation\nally as one of America's leading and out\nstanding rural weekly newspapers.\nThere is a reason for this leadership. It\ncan be summed up briefly. The publishers and\nemployees put their best efforts into every\nissue. They strive to make the paper better\nand better with each succeeding issue. No\nreasonable expense is spared when it will\nallow us to print a more readable, a more in\nformative or a more reliable newspaper. The\nChronicle maintains a larger corps of paid\ncorrespondents than any Delaware weekly\nnewspaper. We endeavor to impress upon\neach correspondent the necessity of accur\nacy in reporting. A member of the Asso\nciated Press, the Chronicle has access to, and\nuses, news and features of national and world\ninterest, which makes our readers among the\nbest informed in the entire nation.\nWe enter our 70th year with bright pros\n> pects for the future. During the past two\nyears we have spent thousands of dollars\nfor new equipment, new type faces and gen\neral modernization of our plant. More ma\nchinery is on order, and will be installed as\nit becomes available. This is being done with\none purpose in view\u2014to keep the Chronicle\nin its enviable position of leadership of which\nwe are justly proud, and which we shall jeal\nously guard in the future.\nAs we enter this 70th year of steady\ngrowth, we pause to thank each and every\none of you\u2014reader, advertiser, correspondent\nand employee, whose patronage and effort\nhave enabled us to produce a bigger and bet\nter Chronicle. Your confidence in the Chron\nicle shall act as an incentive to us to work for\nsC more perfect newspaper for Alford, Kent\nand Sussex Counties and the State of Del\u00e0\nA\nware.\nREPORTS FROM ENGLAND indicate\nthat there is a growing opposition to the pol\nicies of the Labor government\u2014and that it\nis becoming apparent in the ranks of labor\nitself. The cause of that resentment is plain.\nIt is rooted in the fact that the high hopes\nheld out for socialism were a cruel illusion,\nthat rigid regimentation has sapped, not fed,\nthe energies and productive abilities of the\nnation, and that England is now on the verge\nof complete economic disaster.\nThe British people are not complaining\nabout the austerity program\u2014a similar mea\nsure would necessarily have been imposed by\nany government in the interest of industrial\nrecovery. What they are complaining about\nis that the incredible sacrifices made by the\npeople in living standards have gone for\n' nothing. All the basic industries on which\nBritish exports depend\u2014coal, electric power,\nsteel and the rest\u2014have either been social\nized or threatened with socialization. And in\nall of them output has been declining. Poli\nticians, many of them utterly without exper\nience in industry, are the unchallenged mas\nters of England today, and they have shown\na great deal more ability at extending their\nown authority than in getting out the goods\nthat can save England from ruin.\nWhen socialism fails, its advocates al\nways propose more socialism as the cure,\nAnd that has brought still another grave\ndanger to the English people\u2014the loss of\nrights which have been extended since the\nCarta. Labor officiais that freez\ning a worker in his job does not amount to\na labor draft\u2014but that is merely a play on\nwords when the law makes it impossible for\na man to change employment if he so de\nsires. Agriculture has been surrounded with\ndictatonal restrictions, and more have been\nproposed.\nEnglind is a living example of two vital\nly important truths\u2014first, that socialism is\n.\nwasteful and inefficient; and, second, that it\nis basically and inevitably a destroyer of\nmdiyidual liberty. That is the lesson that\nEngland is giving the United States, and it\nis time for us to heed it.\nTHE MINE WORKERS JOURNAL,\nwhich is the official spokesman for the Uni\nted Mine Workers Union, recently took a\nlook at the British coal situation and ob\nserved that English miners have been mis\nled to believe that nationalization would re\nsult in improved working conditions. It crit\nicized labor leader^ who pinned their faith\non political action rather than economic ac\ntion by advocating socialism. Finally, the\nJournal said that the idea that nationaliza\ntion would cure the ills of the coal industry\nconstitutes one of the saddest chapters in\nEnglish history, and should open the eyes of\nevery coal miner to the peril\u00bb involved.\nIt is a good sign when a labor magazine\nspeaks so forthrightly. Everyone who has\nstudied the subject will agree 100 per cent\nwith the Journal's views. The English min\ners are now worse off than under private\nownership because they have lost their free\ndom of action under government dictation.\nEnglish coal production has been alarming\nly low\u2014a fact that underlies the whole Brit\nish economic crisis, and has had serious rep\nercussions in Western Europe which counted\non receiving much more English coal than\nit has been possible to deliver. And, by com\nparison with American coal miners, the Brit\nish miner has very poor wages and working\nconditions.\nNo one knows what the solution will be\nin England\u2014the politicians are the bosses,\nand private enterprise and individual incen\ntive has been destroyed. But every American\n<\u00bbn make up his mind that socialization of\nany basic industry should not be tolerated in\nthe United States. Honest cooperation be\ntween Capital, labor, and government \u00db1 any\nfield, will make free enterprise work infinite\nly better thpn socialism.\nTHE ATTITUDE of a great many peo\npie toward the problem of inflation is not\nhelpful. They dodge the facts involved. Most\npeople cannot build homes. Their ability to\nbuy many 0 f the better foods is diminishing.\nBasic manufacturing industries are con\nfronted with costs which every businessman\nknows threaten to shove prices to the point\n0 f crippling mass production. The distribu\ntion industry, also dependent upon high vol\nume movement of goods, is up against a simi\nl a r situation. Intelligent farmers are aware\nthat disaster is the inevitable consequence of\nendlessly risking prices. Union leaders with\na grain of sense under their hats will admit,\nprivately if not publicly, that a race between\nwages and prices, if continued long enough,\nwill make paupers of American workmen,\nTragic is the attitude of many of our\npublic officials who, while waging a political\nsham battle against inflation, are fully aware\nthat the solvency of the Federal government\nand the integrity of the dollar itself are at\nstake. All of us from the President down are\nobserving the result of inflation and depre\nciated money, in country after country, from\nChina to England. Desperate people in such\ncountries have submitted to ruthless dicta\ntorships which are destroying their liber\nties. They are losing spiritual and. moral\nvalues in a futile scramble for a false secur\nity, the like of which the world has never\nseen.\nIt is almost unbelievable that in the face\nof this situation, leading citizens, in and out\nof public life in the United States, can for a\nmoment play politics with inflation, or utter\na single word which they do not believe to\nbe based upon sound reasoning\u2014yet it is\nbeing done daily.\npl a nk in its platform advocating public own\nership of utilities. Now that plank has been\ndropped. The reason, according to the Du\nluth Herald, is that \"actual bargaining ex\nperience has led the chiefs of some of the\nlarger unions to the conclusion that labor\ncan get more generous contracts from pri\nvate employers and corporations than from\ngovernment agencies. \u25a0\nFOR 'MORE THAN 50 YEARS, the Wis\nconsin State Federation of Labor carried a\n\u00bb\nThese labor leaders also have learned,\nfrom simple observation of affairs abroad,\nthat government ownership of industry\nmeans the death of the free labor movement\nand of strong unions. No one can strike\nagainst the government. No one can chal\nlenge the decisions of the government. There\ncan be no redress from injustice when all\npowerful officials dominate labor's source of\nlivelihood.\nWorst of all, when government takes over\nbusiness, it is almost impossible to get gov\nernment out of business. A revolution or a\ncomplete collapse of the government in pow\ner is necessary. Even then, the transition\nback of a free enterprise system is difficult\nand costly. Socialism exhausts the energies\nof a country and dissipates its capital. It\nplaces a premium on mediocrity and dis\ncourages initiative.

The President's\nconference on fire safety, which was held last\nMay, developed a splendid, all-inclusive pro\ngram for combatting fire. But that program\nwill be worthless without agressive public\nsupport.\nOne of the principal community duties is\nto enact fire prevention ordinances that are\nup to date\u2014and then to enforce them. Thou\nsands of our towns have no ordinances at\na n. Many others have laws which\npletely obsolete. And in others still little or\nno effort is made at enforcement. The cer\ntain result is ever-increasing fire loss,\nquate water facilities must be provided. A\nsmall town cannot have the kind of fire de\npartment that protects a metropolis\u2014but it\ncan have one adequate to meet its needs at\nmoderate cost.\nEvery expert knows that fire can be con\ntrolled\u2014and that losses can be reduced to a\nfraction of their present volume.

Of]\nAmerican dollars, which we are be- 1\ning asked to provide, be used for by !\nthe nations of Western Europe?\nI believe a majority of the Amer\nlean people are willing to assist in\nthe physical rebuilding of those war\ntorn nations, both friend and foe.\nto prevent their coming under dom\nination of totalitarian Communistic\nRussia. The American people\nwould help in rebuilding and re\nequiping Western European facto\nries, railroads and other utilities,\nfarms, homes and other things nec\nessary to put the people of those\nnations on their feet so they again\nmay support themselves.\n1 do not believe any large\nnumber of the American people\nare willing to contribute finan\ncially to promotion of the theo\nries and policies of a political\nparty, sis we did to the extent\nof some four\nthe case of England. To a large\nextent our money, directly or\nindirectly, went to finance ex\nperiments in National Social\nism, not to rebuild and re-equip\nEngland's factories.\n\u2022 H th\u00e7 people of France, England\nor any other Western European na\ntion, want to play with National So\ncialism, that is their privilege, but\nthe American people will not again\nprovide the money to finance such\nexperiments.\nCongress should, and I believe\nwill, tie such strings to an y appro\npriation made to aid Western Eu\nropean rehabilitation as will prevent\nany American money being used,\ndirectly or indirectly, for any ex\nperiment in government or political\nparty theories.\nWhatever aid we may provide\nfor rehabilitation of Western\nEuropean countries we should\nwrite off as a gift, and not fool\nourselves by considering it a\nloan. We know, from experience,\nit will not be repaid, any more\nthan were the loans made dur\ning, and following World War I.\nThey were accepted as loans,\nbut when payment became due,\nall, with exception of little Fin\nland, repudiated. That was true\nof France, England, Germany\nand Belgiunl. We made definite\nloans to those nations. They\nwere accepted as such. They\nwere better able to pay then\nthan they are now, or will be\nfor many years in the future.\nThey repudiated. We could not\ncollect. We will never collect\nfor anything we may advance\nat this time. There is no rea\nson for our carrying such an ac\ncount as an asset, for it never\nwould be paid.\nOur aid in rehabilitation of West\nern Europe is not entirely unselfish.\nSuch rehabilitation has a definite\nvalue to us. Without our aid they\nmost certainly will fall under the\ndomination of totalitarian Commu\nnistic Russia.' Their resources and\nmanpower will be controlled by\nRussia. Such a condition would\ngive Russia a war potential we\ncould not meet. It would constitute\na grave threat to this country and\nto the world. It would mean a ful\nfillment of that Russian dream of a\nCommunistic world, and the end of\nour American free enterprise.\nINFLATION HELPS DEBTORS\nTHOSE who are in debt are the\nonly ones who can profit from infla\ntion, from cheap money. The Unit\ned States government, as the great\nest debtor in the nation, stands to\nprofit most from the inflation we so\ngreatly fean The government has\npromised to pay some 260 billion\ndollars to those who hold its bonds.\nIn that promise there is no specifi\ncation as to the value of the dollars\nthe creditor is to receive. Runaway\ninflation could make our dollars\npractically valueless, but they still\nwould be dollars. The government\ncould pay off its bonded indebted\nness with 260 billion of such value\nless dollars. For those who own\nbonds there is no way to hedge.\nSelling them now would not help as\nthe dollars received now would\nhave, if we had runaway inflation,\nno greater value then than the dol\nlar of that time. The best gamble\nwould be to held on, if the govern\nment does not call the bonds, until\nthe value of the dollar comes back,\nas it will in time. Big corporations\ncan profit from inflation by pay\ning off their bonded indebtedness\nwith cheap collars. That may be\nthe reason for paying labor more\nwages without much argument.\nGovernment of the majority, by\nthe majority find for the majority\nis the American way. Minority leg\nislation is un-American and un\npopular.\nThis time the bulk of mort\ngage foreclosures will be on\nSown and city homes instead of\non farms.\nWar Damage Claims\nFor Solomon Islands\nLONDON\u2014 (\u00c6*) \u2014A commission to\nlist and examine war damage\nclaims in the Solomons, Gilbert ami\nEllice Islands in the South Pacific\nhas been set up by the Colonial of-|\nflee.\nW.

Such a\nhoisting as the freespenders are\nconversing about would be a sensa\ntional further updraft on inflation,\nwhich probably could be gained only\nby higher prices and wages, as the\nnation already is gainfully employed\nto just about the utmost. But such\nan updraft could be forced no doubt\nby giving 29 billions more to Eu\nropean nations.\nFrom the other side, you hear\nexactly the opposite story. High\nbeginning to cause\n!\n, . . . . . . . ..\nvelopmg, but chiefly because the\neconomic factors at hand so far are\nso indefinite and insecure no man\nwho watches his words could pos\nsibly use many arbitrary ones in\nsuch a situation.\ndiminution of unit sales, say the\nnon - New Dealers. In many\ncases dollar volume of sales is\noff, but in others, where it is np\nslightly, the increase represents\nsales of fewer units sold for\nmore money.\nNot so much money is being\nthrown around loosely in domestic\nmarkets of all kinds. Thus the de\nvotees of this side of the question\nare concluding the top of inflation\nalready has been reached and we\nare in for the reaction this fall or\nafter the turn of the year.\n\u2022NATURAL GROWTH' THEORY\nIn such a situation, prophesying\nwould seem to be a fool's business.\nNot only because these opposing\nschools of economic thought are de\nThe economic fallacies which\nare running around loose\nthrough the daily news in the\npapers approach ridiculousness.\nThe thought is being presented,\nfor instance, that the new hike\nin national income can work dut\nfrom \"the natural growth\" of\nthe country. Similarly, some au\nthorities are saying, even in fi\nnancial Journals, that inflation\nordinarily comes after wars and\nwe need a national income of\n200 billion dollars to carry in\nand retire the war debt.\nThese suppositions are only frac\ntionally and dangerously true. The\nnational debt itself was made tax\nable under Treasury Secretary Mor\ngenthau. While the budget carries\nan appropriation of 5.1 billion dol\nlars to pay the interest on it next\nyear, the burden of interest is some\nwhat less, because an inestimable\nportion of this amount will be taken\nfrom bondholders in taxes during\ndepressions or plenty. An inflated\ndollar may retire a debt more\neasily, but it is a long way to retire\na debt of 250 billion dollars with an\nannual retirement fund of 3 to 7 bil\nlions. And it takes a lot of \"natural\ngrowth\" to pay off 250 billions.\n\u2022 . \u00ab \u2022*\nESCAPIST REASONING\nThe indispensable main point of\nthis matter\u2014the point which is\nbeing forgotten\u2014is that in inflating\nyour dollar you can very easily\nbankrupt the workings of a nation\nand make it impossible for the coun\ntry to earn enough to sustain itself,\nmuch less pay off both debts and in\nterest. By constantly hoisting prices\nand wages (the wage increases al\nways lag behind the price increases\nand most people do not get the same\nincrease\"), you do not actually make\ndebt payment easier for the people\nthemselves, but you make it more\ndifficult to keep the impetus of busi\nness strong as prices get too high.\nThe necessity for defending\nand fighting for some common\nsense in all this current folly of\ndiscussion was never greater\nthan at this moment. If be an\nswer is to be worked out at all,\nit must be done by insisting\nupon reasonableness and dis\ncounting the advice of fools.\njoq many people in this country\nhave gone into escapist reasoning\nQ f economics.

He said he scribbled a\nnote and sent it up to the Presi\n\u201d dent, explaining that he meant\nno harm, but felt he should bring\nthe cap because, \u201cEstes and Nancy\n(Mrs. Kefauver) had to stay in\nNebraska.\u201d\n5,183 Meals Served.\nComparative statistics were not\nImmediately available, but the\nchefs of the Mayflower and Stat\nler hotels after counting their re\nmaining steaks came to the con\nclusion that they had served 5.183\nmeals.\nThe President, dressed in a\ndinner jacket, spent the first part\nof the evening at a table at one\nend of the huge hall, then moved\nto the long table at the other\nend to give more party stalwarts\na better look and a few hand\nshakes.\nThe diners sat at 611 tables. As\non previous occasions, the engi\nneering problem of delivering hot\nfood simultaneously to such a\nvast area of white n&pery was\naccomplished successfully. The\nice cream was made in donkey\nshaped moulds. Some of the last\nto arrive at the tables were be\nginning to resemble elephants be\ncause of the melting process.\nThe menu was a simple one:\nGrapefruit, filet mignon. Amer\nican champagne or burgundy, a\nhearts of lettuce salad with\nRoquefort dressing and the ice\ncream, plus cakes and demitasse.\nEconomy of Dinners.\nThere is an idea among the\nuninformed that these festive.\nDemocrats actually eat SIOO worth\nof food on these occasions. That\nis about 7.5 per cent correct. The\neconomy of the operation is\nroughly this: The dinner costs\nabout $7.50 a plate, the promo\ntion about $2.50 and each dinner\nmakes a S9O contribution to the\nparty. It is the most successful\nfund-raising scheme In the his\ntory of the Democratic Party and\nthat history is a long one.\nThat was early in the evening,\n\u2022 before Mr. Truman made his\nstartling announcement about not\nbeing a candidate.\nThe stirring incident of the pre\nliminaries was the introduction of\nSecretary of State Acheson and\nMrs. Acheson. The guests had\ngiven perfunctory applause to the\nintroduction of other cabinet-offi\ncer* and high party functionaries\nat the north head table. But\nwhen Mr. Acheson's name was an\nnounced they all stood and ap\nplauded with a fighting spirit the\nman often called a party liability.\nThe youngest guest at the din\nner was 6-year-old Betty Ann\nBullard, who came from Newport,\nTenn. with her father, Col. M.\nBullard.\nThe little girl wore a Kefauver\nbutton. She saw the President\non one side of the hall and then\nwas taken over to visit Mrs. Tru\nman, seated on the other side. Her\nfather explained the Kefauver\nbutton this way:\n\u201cWe\u2019re always for Truman but\nhe isn\u2019t running. If he runs we\nare for him.\u201d\nSteel\n(Continued From First Page.)\n1, and still another of 2% cents\nnext January.\nThe Government estimates the\ni cost to producers of the entire\nf \u201cpackage\u201d as about $6 a ton, with\n: the immediate cost about $4. Hie\nf producers claim the total cost will\nv be sl2, but it is known they will\ni settle for less. '\nBut under present price rules,\nthe only raise that could be al\nlowed producers is, one of slightly\nmore than $2 a ion, which will\nbe allowed to absorb higher costs\nincurred before last January. The\nCapehart amendment to the con\ntrols law requires the Government\nto provide for such higher costs\nand the producers will get it any\nway.\nPresent Rides Cited.\nPrice officials contend the steel\nindustry\u2019s earnings are so high\nthat they cannot be given a fur\nther increase under present rules\neven after raising the wages of\nthe steelworkers.\nthe year as the wages of the\nsteelworkers rise.\n\u201cPackage\u201d Recommended.\nThe Wage StabUzation Board\nhas recommended in settlement\nSome officials believe high prices\ncould be allowed steel because the\nIndustry\u2019s production facilities\nare being vastly expanded to pro\nvide materials for defense. They\nargue that a recent slackening to\ndemand for steel is threatening\nthe expansion program and the\nproducers need an \u201cincentive\u201d to\ncomplete it.\nMeanwhile, wage contract nego\n. tuitions between six big com\npanies, producing 70 per cent of\nthe Nation\u2019s steel, and the union\nheaded by CIO President Philip\nMurray will be resumed in New\nYork tomorrow. }\nThe conference was arranged\nby the producers and indicated\nthey had received assurances the\nGovernment would allow a price\nincrease substantially larger than\nthe forthcoming under the\nCapehart amendment.\nMr. Murray has said firmly the\nunion will accept no less than is\nprovided in Wage Board pro\nposals.\nText of President Truman's Address at Jefferson-Jackson Day Dinner *\nThe prepared text of Presi\ndent Truman\u2019s speech at thei\nJefferson-Jackson Day dinner ,\nHere last night follows. At the\nvery end of his address the\nPresident interpolated his an\nnouncement that he would not\nbe a candidate for re-election.\nI am very happy to be here to\nnight.\nThis makes seven Jefferson-\nJackson Dinners that I have\nspoken to in the City of Washing\nton.\nThey have all been wonderful\ndinners. One pf the things I like\nabout the dinners is the fact that\nthey are political meetings. 1 like\npolitical meetings and I like poli\ntics.\nPolitics\u2014good politics\u2014is public\nservice. There is no life or occupa\ntion in which a man can find a\ngreater opportunity to serve his\ncommunity or his country.\nI have been in politics for more\nthan 30 years, and I know that\nnothing else could have given me\ngreater satisfaction.\nI am sure that all of you here to\nnight are very much interested in\nthe presidential election this year.\nIn view of that fact. I thought\nI would give you a little analysis\nof the political situation.\nThe political situation In this\ncountry may look complicated; but\nyou can find the key to it in one\nsimple thing: the Republicans\nhave been out of office for 20 long\nyears\u2014and they are desperate to\n[get back in control.\nFor 20 years the Republicans\nhave been wandering in a political\ndesert\u2014like camels looking for an\noasis. And if they don\u2019t find it\npretty soon, the Republican Party\nmay die out altogether.\nAdvice on Republican Error*.\nYou know, I would hate to see\nthat happen. I would like to keep ;\nthe Republican Party alive, if that\nis possible. So I am going to offer\nthem a little advice abbut the\nerror of their ways.\nThere are some very good rea\nsons, why the Republicans have\nbeen out of office so long and\nhaven\u2019t been able to get back in\ncontrol.\nThe first reason is that they\nwere voted out in 1932 because\nthey had brought the country to\nthe brink of ruin.\nDuring the 19205, the Republi\ncan Administrations drew back in 1\npetrified isolation from our world 1\nresponsibilities. They spent all\ntheir time trying to help the rich\nget richer, and paid no attention\nto the welfare of the workers and\nthe farmers. All in all, they paved\nthe way for the biggest economic 1\nsmash-up this country has ever :\nseen.\nThat Is the reason the Repub\nlicans were thrown out of office ;\nin 1932 and one of the very good\nreasons they have been kept out\never since. The people don\u2019t want i\nany more \u201cGreat Depressions.\u201d\nThe second reason why the Re\npublicans have been out of office\nfor 20 years Is that the Demo\ncratic Party has been giving the\ncountry good Government.' In\nstead of trying to build up the 1\nprosperity of the favored few, and \u2022\nletting some of it trickle down to ;\nthe rest, we have been working\nto raise the incomes of the vast\nmajority of the people. We have\nbeen steadily expanding the base\nfor prosperity and freedom in\nthis country. The people have\nkept right or re-electing Demo- 1\ncrats because we have been serv- ;\ning them well and they know it.\nNever Agreed on Program.\nThe third reason the Republi\ncans have been kept out of power 1\nfor 20 years is because they have\nnever been able to agree on a\nsensible program to put before the\ncountry. They have been on al-\nBarkley Declares\nGovernment Has No\"\nRoom for Any Crook\nFacing up squarely to the cor\nruption issue, Vice President Bar\nkley told the Jefferson-Jackson\nDay dinner last night \u201cthere is no 1\nroom for any crook\" in the Gov\nernment, and that President Tin\nman has acted promptly in every\ncase brought to his attention.\nRecalling scandals in Republi\ncan administrations going back to\nthe time of President Grant. Mr.\nBarkley said, \u201ceverybody knows\nthat no political party has a mo\nnopoly on honesty and integrity.\u201d\n\u201cOs course,\u201d the Vice President\ncontinued, \u201cthe President of the\nUnited States cannot look over\nthe shoulder of two and one-half\nmillion Federal employes, 99 and\n99/100ths per cent of whom are\nhonest, hardworking, law-abiding.\nGod-fearing, and in many cases\nunderpaid men and women.\u201d\nBest on Foreign Policy.\nMr. Barkley was at his best,;\nhowever, when he turned to differ-:\nences among Republicans oven\nforeign policy\n\u201cWith Mr Hoover seeking to\npull us out of Europe, with Mr.\nTaft seeking to push us into\nChina, with Mr. Stassen standing\nlike a giant revolving searchlight\nwith eyes and ears turning to\ncatch a sound or a glimpse from\nany direction. \u25a0 and with the\nshadow of Gen. Mac Arthur hover\ning like Poe\u2019s raven over all their\nbedchambers, the Old Guard Re\npublican policy makers are like\nthe Irishman\u2019s definition of the\nseige of Port Arthur during the\nRusso-Japanese war of 1904-5,\u201d\nsaid Mr. Barkley.\nHe said the city was under seige\nand >that each day dispatches\nfrom the Paciflce reported that\nPort Arthur was \u201cin status quo.\u201d\nExasperates Reporters.\nAfter seeing this message for\nmany days. Mr. Barkley said two\nexasperated reporters asked an\nIrishman what the monotonous\ndispatches meant. The Irishman\nanswered:\n1 \u201cWell, I am not a military\ngenius and know little about geog\nraphy. nor am I up to date on the\nlanguage of the Caesars. But,\nfrom what you have told me and\nfrom my understanding of the\n1 situation, \u2018in status quo\u2019 means\nthat Port Arthur is in a hell of a\nThe Vice President reminded\n) those who complain of the taxes\ni necessary for defense that \u201cour\n\u25a0 prosperity and economic strength\npermit them to contribute in taxes\nmost every side of every question,\nbut they have seldom been on the\nrtght side.\n' ..In 1936, they said the New Deal\nwas terrible and they were against\nit and all its works. And in the\nelection that fall they lost by a\nlandslide.\nIn 1940, they admitted there\nmight be some good in some parts\nof the New Deal, but they said\nyou needed a Republican to run\nit. And they were beaten again.\n' In 1944, the Republicans said\nthe New Deal might have been\ngood in its day, but it had gotten\nold and tired and it was no good\nany more. But the people didn\u2019t\nagree, and the Republicans Were\nsnowed under.\nIn 1948, they said\u2014well, as a\nmatter of fact, by 1948 they were\nso sure of winning, they really\ndidn't bother to take & position\non anything. And they got just\nwhat they deserved\u2014-another lick\ning.\nBy now the Republicans can't\nfigure out what to do. Every day\nyou hear a new Republican theory\nof how to win the election in 1962.\nThe Dinosaur School.\nOne theory they have is that\nthey ought to come right out\nand say they are against all the\nadvances the country has made\nsince 1932.\nThis is the dinosaur school of\nRepublican strategy. They want to\ntake us back to prehistoric times.\nRepublicans of this school say\u2014\n\u201c Let\u2019s stop beating about the bush\nlet\u2019s say what we really believe.\nLet\u2019s say we\u2019re against social se\ncurity\u2014that we\u2019re against labor\nunions and good wages\u2014that\nwe\u2019re opposed to price supports\nfor farmers\u2014that we\u2019re against\nthe Government doing anything\nfor anybody except big business.\u201d\nNow, I have a lot of sympathy\nfor these Republicans. They have\nbeen hushed up for a long time.\nThey would certainly be happier\nif they could tell the troth for\nonce and campaign for what they\nreally believe. It would be good for\ntheir souls. But it wouldn't be\ngood for their party. This dino\nsaur school of Republican strategy\nwould only get the dinosaur vote\u2014\nand there aren\u2019t many dinosaurs\nleft.\nNext there is the Republican\ntheory that the Republicans can\nwin if they oppose the foreign\npolicy of the United States. They\ncan\u2019t agree among themselves as\nto how they want to oppose it,\nbut most of them want to oppose\nit somehow.\nSome Republicans seem to\nthink it would be popular to pull\nout of Korea, and to abandon\nEurope, and to let the United Na\ntions go to smash. They reason\nthis way\u2014\u201c The American people\naren\u2019t very bright. Let\u2019s tell them\nthey don\u2019t have to build up de\nfenses, or serve in the Army, or\nstrengthen our Allies overseas. If\nthey fall for that, then we Repub\nlicans will be in\u2014and that\u2019s all\nthat matters.\u201d\nPeople Are Smarter.\nThe trouble with this Republi\ncan theory is that the American\npeople are a lot smarter than the\nRepublicans who thought it up.\nThe American people have learned\na lot from two world wars and\nfrom the last seven years of work\ning to keep the peace. They know\nthat as long as communism is\nloose in the world we must have\nallies and we must resist aggres\nsion. The American people are\nliving in the atomic age, and they\nknow that the ideas of the stone\nage won\u2019t work any more\u2014if they\never did.\nThen there is another group of\nRepublicans who attack our\nforeign policy by advocating the\n\u201call-out\u201d or \u201clet\u2019s get it over with\u201d\nto these defenses more than twice\nthe total of all their combined\nincome in 1932, and then have left\nin their pockets more than four\nand one half their total income\nfor that same year.\u201d\nSubstandard Drugs Fought\nPharmacists in India are being\nurged by the government to co\noperate In a fight against sub\nstandard drugs which are said to\nbe harming the health of the peo\nple.\n?,l Oriental *\u2022\u201c\u00bb\u201d !\n\u201crugs*\nImagine, perfect reproductions I 6x9 KIRMAN\nof world famous Orientals ...

These are the Republicans\nwho say they want to expand the\nfighting in Korea, and start\ndropping atomic bombs, and invite\na new world war. They figure 4t\u2019s\ngood politics to talk that way.\nThey don\u2019t stop to count the cost.\nThey think people don\u2019t under\nstand that the hardest and bravest\nthing in the world is to work for\npeace\u2014not war. But if\u2019war comes\n\u2014if the showdown comes\u2014these\nloud talkers would be the first\npeople to run for the bomb\nshelters. And the voters know it.\nNone of these Republican theo\nries of how to win the election\nholds much promise of success\nthis year. All they show is that\nthe platform the Republicans\nwrite in Chicago to July will have\nto be a fearful and wonderful\nthing to cover all these different\ntheories. It wifi have to be a bigger\ntent that the Ringling Brothers\ncircus\u2014and it will have to cover\njust about as many freaks.\n\u201cWhite Is Black\u201d Campaign.\nThe real Republican campaign\nis not going to be fought on the\nissues. Hie Republicans are going\nto wage a campaign of phony\npropaganda. They are going to\ntry what we might call the \u201cwhite\nis black\u201d and \u201cblack is white\u201d\nstrategy. Hie reasoning behind it\nis this: The Republicans know\nthat the Nation is strong and pros\nperous, that we are building up\ndefenses against communism, that\nthe Democratic Administration\nhas worked for the good of the\npeople. The only chance for the\nRepublicans, therefore, is to mnirn\nthe people think these facte aren\u2019t\nso. The job for the Republicans\nis to make people believe that\nwhite is black and black is white.\n* That is a pretty difficult way to\nwin an election. It wouldn\u2019t ap\npeal to anybody but a very des\nperate politician. But the Repub\nlicans have some reason for think\ning it might succeed. They will\nhave the support of most of the\npress, and most of the radio com\nmentators. They may have the\nprofessional poll-takers with them\nagain. The Republicans, as al\nways. will have a lot of money.\nThey have slick advertising ex\nperts. And they don\u2019t have too\nmany scruples about how they use\nthem. Remember the carpetbag\nger from Chicago who got\nconvicted for the way he elected\na Republican Senator in Maryland\nin 1950.\nThe Republicans are all set to\ntry this \u201cwhite is black\u201d technique.\nThis is the way it will work. First\nof all they will try to make people\nbelieve that everything the Gov\nernment has done for the country\nis socialism. They will go to\nthe people and say\u2014\u201cDo you see\nthat social security check you\nthought that was good for you,\ndidn\u2019t you? Too bad! That\u2019s\nsocialism. Do you see that new\nflood control dam the Government\nis building over there? Sorry\u2014it\u2019s\nsocialism! The new hospital, same\nthing. Price supports, more so\ncialism. Minimum wage laws? So\ncialism! Socialism is bad for\nyou, m& friend. Everybody knows\nthat. And here you are, with your\nnew car, and your home, and better\nopportunities for the kids, and a\ntelevision set\u2014just surrounded by\nSocialism! It\u2019s a terrible thing,\nmy friend, and the only way out\nof this sinkhole of socialism, is\nto vote Republican.\u2019'\nNow, do you think they can sell\nthat bill of goods? This country\ntoday has more freedom for all its\npeople than any country in the\nhistory of the world. And all the\nefforts of all the Republican poli\nticians can\u2019t convince the people\nthat this is socialism.\nQuestion of Communism.\nThe next part of the \u201cwhite is\nblack\u201d campaign is to try to make\nthe people believe that the Demo-\nFormer Senator Pepper\nBecomes 111 at Dinner\nBy th* Associated Brass\nClaude Papper, former Demo\ncratic senator from Florida, was\ntaken ill while attending the\nJefferson-Jackson Day dinner but\napparently was not In serious con\ndition.\nMrs. Pepper said she believed\nher husband was suffering from\na virus Infection.\nAfter becoming 111, Mr. Pepper\ncratic Party is In favor of com\nmunism. This is an even tougher\njob than selling the socialism non\nsense, but the Republicans axe\ndesperate, so they are making a\ntry at it.\nOs course, we have spent billions\nof dollars to build up our defenses\nagainst communism; we have cre\nated an alliance of free nations\nagainst communism; we are help\ning them to arm against com\nmunism; we have met Mid halted\ncommunism in Greece and Turkey,\nand Berlin and Austria and Italy\nand Dan, and most importantly\nin Korea. We have fought com\nmunism abroad, and we have\nfought it at home. We hate an\nFBI and a Central Intelligence\nAgency defending us\nand saboteurs. The Federal loy\nalty program keeps Communists\nout of Government.\nThat\u2019s the record, and how do\nthe Republicans propose to get\naround it? Herets the technique.\nThey go to the voters and soy\n\u201cDid you know the Government\nwas full of Communists?\u201d And\nthe voters say, \u201cNo. What makes\nyou say that?\u201d And then the Re\npublicans explain that somebody\nnamed Joe Doakes works for the\nGovernment, and he has a cousin\nwho sells shoe laces, and this cou\nsin has a wife who wrote an arti\ncle, before he married her, that\nwas printed in a magazine that\nalso printed an article to favor\nof the Chinese Communists\u2014and\nso on. This may sound very silly\n-and it is. But some political\nfakers spend all their time trying\nto pull the woO? over people\u2019s eyes\nwith this sort of nonsense.\nThe real test of anti-commun\nism is whether we are willing to\ndevote our resources and our\nstrength to stopping Communist\naggression and saving free people\nfrom its horrible tyranny. That\nkind of anti-communism tnk p s\nmoney and courage\u2014not just talk.\nAnd the next time you hear some\nof this loud ahti-Commuuiat talfc\nfrom our Republican friends, ask\nthem how they have voted\u2014on aid\nto Greece, on the Marshall Plan,\non tiie Mutual Security Program.\nThe chances are they voted to cut\nor cripple these all-important\nmeasures against communism.\nI say to you to all seriousness,\nbeware of those who pretend to be\nso violently anti-Communist in th< s\ncountry, and at the same time vote\nto appease communion abroad. In\nmy book, that is talking out of\nboth sides of tiie mouth at once;\nand I don\u2019t think the American\npeople are going to be taken in by\nit*\nMorality in Government.\nThe next part of the Republican\n\u201cWhite is Mack\u201d campaign is to\ntry to fool the voters Into thinking\nthat the Democratic Party is dis\nhonest\u2014that the Government is\nfull of grafters and thieves and all\nkinds of assorted crooks. To hear\nthem talk you wouldn\u2019t think there\nwas an honest man in Washington.\nNow, I want to say something\nvery important to you about this\nissue of morality in government.\nI stand for honest government.\nI have worked for it. I have prob\nably done more than any other\nPresident to reorgaffiae the Gov\nernment on efficient lines, \u00ab\u00abi to\nextend the civil service merit sys\ntem.\nI hate corruption not only be\ncause it is had in itself, but also\nbecause it is the deadly enemy of\nall things the Democratic Party\nhas been doing all these years. I\nhate corruption anywhere, but I\nhate It most of all in a Democratic\nofficeholder, because It is a be\ntrayal of all the Democratic Party\nstands for.\nHere is the reason. To me,\nmorality to Government means\nmore than a mere absence of\nwrongdoing. It means a Govern\nment that is fair to all. I think\nStudent Conference Nears\nThe Mason-Dixon regional con\nference on the National Students\nAssociation will be held in the\nMusic building of Catholic Uni\nversity Friday and Saturday.\nCatholic University student mem\nbers of the NSA will be hosts.

It te just as immoral to\nuse the Law-making power of the\nGovernment to enrich the few at\nthe expense of the many, as it\nis to steal money from the public\ntreasury.\nLegislation Was Corruption.\nAll of us know, of course, about\nthe scandals and corruption of the\nRepublican officeholders to the\n1820\u2019s. But to my mind the Vet-\nMans Administration scandals, to\nthose days, and the Teapot Ddme\nsteal, were no worse\u2014no more im\nmoral\u2014than the tax laws \\of\nAndrew Mellon, or the attempt to\nsell Muscle Shoals to private in\nterests. Legislation that favored\nthe creed of monopoly and the\ntrickery of Wall Street was a foftn\nof corruption that did the country\nmore harm than Teapot Dome.\nPrivate; selfish interests are\nalways trying to corrupt the Gov\nernment in this way. Powerful\nfinancial groups Me always try\ning to get favors for themselves.\nNow, the Democratic adminis\ntration has been fighting against\nthese efforts to corrupt the powers\nof Government. We haven\u2019t always\nwon, but we have never surren\ndered, and we \"hever will.\nFor all these years, we have been\nfighting to use our natural re\nsources for the benefit of the pub\nlic, to develop our forests and pub\nlic oil reserves and water power\nfor the benefit of all, to raise the\nincomes of sll our citlzejte, to\nprotect the farmer and worker\nagainst the power of monopoly.\nAnd where have the Republi\ncans been in this fight for mor\nality in Government? Do they\ncome out and vote wlth us to keep\nthe special interests from robbing\nthe public? Not at all. Most of\nthem are oh tfie other side.\nConduct of Officials.\nIt\u2019S the same thing when you\ncome to the question of the con\nduct of Government officials. The\nRepublicans make a great whoop\nand holler about the honesty of\nFederal employes, but they are\nusually the first to show up in a\nGovernment office asking for\nspecial favors for private Interests,\nand raising cain if they don\u2019t\nget them. These Republican\ngentlemen can\u2019t have it both ways\n\u2014they can\u2019t be for morality on\nTuesday and Thursday, and then\nbe for special privileges for their\nclients on Monday, Wednesday\nand Friday.\nI\u2019m disgusted with these efforts\nto discredit and blacken the char\nacter and reputation of the whole\nFederal service.

We hold to the\nIdeal that goes back to Jefferson,\nthat a fanner should have the\nopportunity to own his farm, to\nshare to the benefits of scientific\nprogress, and to secure a fair in\ncome tor his efforts.\nHie Democratic Party is work\ning for the success of our free\nenterprise system. We have\nworked to prevent monopoly, to\ngive the small business man a fair\nchance, and to develop our natu\nral resources for aU the people\nand not Just for the* favored few.\nThe Democratic Party is work\ning for tiie welfare of labor.

A a long aa that right la denied any\nno man's rights are safe.\nFRIDAY. JUNE 27, 1982\nLet The Best Man Win\nThe Republican national convention in Chicago beginning\nJuly 7, will be one of the most interesting political party con\nfabs in the past 20 years. The intense struggle between Senator\nRobert Taft anti General Dwight Eisenhower is being watched\nwith avid interest by millions of Americans and countless other\ncitizens of other nations throughout the world.\nTaft, a capable, self-willed man, who seems to put property\nrights above human rights and is, some fear, an isolationist, is\npitted against Eisenhower, a proven military executive and or\nganizer who up to this point seems to have tremendous popular\nappeal to millions of American voters.\nTaft has been working at this presidential candidate busi\nness for twelve years, lie is supported by most of the top pro\nfessionals in the party and they are a ruthleas, no-holds barred\ngroup as has been proven by his Texas and Louisiana delegate\nfight.\nEisenhower\u2019s supporters, aside from a few are the newer\nfigures in the national party circles and the younger members\nof the party who are considered GOP liberuls. They have not\nhad the experience found in the Taft camp. Apparently, Ikes\nforces are not so \u201cwell heeled*'financially either.\nThere is little to choose as far as the Negro voter is con\ncerned between the two candidates. If a choice were necessary,\nin this newspaper\u2019s opinion, it would be Eisenhower despite his\nmiserable showing on the civil rights issue.\nTaft is not for a civil rights program. He has used the\ncivil rights question as a political tool to build an unholy al\nliance between conservative Republicans and the Dixiecrats in\nthe Senate to hamstring the present administration\u2019s legislative\nprogram, lie speaks glibly about an FEPC with educational\nprovisions without any kind of compulsory machinery. Taft\nknows that this type of legislation will not cure the ills of\njob discrimination. He claims he is fearful that a compulsory\nFEPC would cause trouble, especially in the south. In this he\nreminds one of the South Carolina Democrats who bellowed\nthat \u201cblood would run in the gutters\u2019\u2019 if a U. S. Supreme\nCourt decision allowing Negroes to vote in the Palmetto State\nwas upheld 1 No blood ran and thousands of Negroes enrolled as\nvoters to cast ballots for the candidate of their preference. Taft,\nin our humble opinion, has no feeling for the TJ. S. minorities\nany more than he has for the U. S. working man.\nEisenhower\u2019s civil rights stand might be excused on the\ngrounds that upon his return to America he was expected to\ngive his views on such an imposing variety of issues that he\ncould not be expected to do very good on all of them. Cer\ntainly, since the civil rights issue is going to plague any candi\ndate, \"Ike\u2019\u2019 should have had some advice from top-flight Ne\ngro leaders, not necessarily Negro political leaders, but those\nselfless leaders who are anxious that each of the two parties\nput up the best man for president within their party ranks.\nFrom Eisenhower\u2019s inept handling of the civil rights issue and\nthe question of a Negro for the cabinet you could see that he\nhas not taken time to he informed.\nHis answers to many other questions also indicated that\nhe must have devoted most of his time in recent months as\nSupreme Commander in Europe to the job at hand, and not to\nhis impending campaign for the Republican nomination. This\nis to his credit, but does not register with the voters who are\napt to consider that his insufficient, wandering answers are\nsigns of weakness rather than a lack of time to thoughtfully\nconsider the issues, which \u201cIke'* certainly did not have in\nEurope.\nIt\u2019s going to be quite some battle for supremacy in Chicago\nwhen the Grand Old Party gets together to nominate a candi\ndate. As an independent paper interested more in issues and\naccomplishments than in parties, we can say that we hope the\nbest man wins.\nWe\u2019re For Humphrey For President\nA wag writes in to ask who we are for for president. That's\neasy\u2014this piper thinks that young .Mr. Hubert 11. Humphrey,\njunior U. S. Senator from Minnesota stands head and shoulders\nabove all candidates we\u2019ve seen and heard in ability, devotion\nto the people and the nation. More than that we believe he\nwould make a darn good president.\nThe other two Democrats who might receive our nod would\nbe Averill Ilarrimnn or Adloi Stevenson. We think Humphrey\nhas it all over either of them in personality, energy and know\nledge.\nHe\u2019s the best speaker the Democrats have in their ranks\nand can out-talk and out-think any Republican prospect\u2014\nstanding on his feet on a platform or sitting before a micro\nphone.\nHis eritics say he\u2019s glib, but his glibness, when put down in\ncold print makes sense. Some Minnesotans have been spending\nmoney and trying to make Harold Stasson president for a num\nber of years. Harold in his best days had not the vigor of mind,\nthe vibrant personality of Humphrey. Harold has had his try\nand has apparently failed to gain his much desired objective.\nNow Minnesota may offer the nation Humphrey who has more\nplatform appeal and general all-around statesmanship than\nany candidate in the field of either party.\nThe above is probably some wishful thinking on our part\nfor in 1952, since it is apparent that Humphrey himself is not\nyet seriously considering entering the race despite his Minne\nsota favorite son status. We hope he does not run for vice\npresident. He would strengthen any ticket with his campaign\ning ability but we hope he doesn\u2019t settle for any second place *\nfor in our books he is first place timber.\nUsed to be that people lost their shirts now and then in the\nstock market.

The income of the average Negro family or white\nfamily for that matter, is seriously overtaxed to educate chi 1 -\ndren, especially those of college level.\nYoungsters in high school ought to be informed of the\nvarious scholarships which go to outstanding students. This\nwould be an incentive for good grade and also might be the\nmeans by which many students obtain a college education.\nDEATHS OF CHURCH, WILSON.\nSIMMONS AND DcPRIEST ROBS\nGOP OF STRONG NEGRO LEADERS\nBy JAMES A. lIAMI.ETT In the Kansas PLAINDEADER\nThe recent deaths of Bob Church and J. Finley Wilson re\nmoved from the scene two outstanding Republican leaders.\nLast year, Col. Itoscoe Simmons and Oscar DcPricst answered\nthe roll call. Only Perry Howard, Emmett Scott and one or\ntwo others of the old school remain to head the \u201cAbe Lincoln\u201d\npolitical philosophy.\nThe new day Negro political\nleaders have more or less been\nallied with the New Dea), the\nFair Deal and other liberal move\nments promoted by the late\nFranklin D. Roosevelt and Harry\nS. Truman.\nChurch, Wilson and DePriest\nand Simmons were great Republi\ncans and have done a great work\nin paving the way for political\nopportunities . . . The time In\nwhich they had power had Its\nlimitations for the colored man\nand they could not do much for\nthe masses ... A few political\nJobs were handed out here and\nthere, just enough to keep them\ntalking about \"ABE\". Social, eco\nnomic ami political gains remain\ned more or less static or rather at\n\"status quo\". In fact, their hands\nwere tied to cheap political pat\nronage and the purse strings of\nthe \"Old Guards,\" who drove the\nNegroes from the Republican\nparty.\nThe breakdown of solid Repub\nlican votes in the Negro rare\nstarted in 1912, but reached it all\ntime high in 19.76 when Roosevelt\nswamped Alt I-andon by carrying\nhis own state. Kansas. Since that\ntime, politics to the Negro has\nbeen a business proposition\nthrough which certain social, ec\nonomic and political gains are de\nmanded.\nThe old time Negro \u201cdarkle\"\ntype is gone. At least that type\ndoes not represent the present\nday Negro. Of course, there may\nbe a few of the handkerchief head\ntype who are still trying to hang\non with the only technique they\nFather, can my now boy fri\nIt's\nwho died this morning?\ncan make the necessary arrange\nCraig (Colo.) Courier\n\"O K ! Now-Play Ball!''\nknow (the hat-in-the hand) (Me\nto-boss) but investments in that\nchannel have long proven to be a\nloss to those who seek to promote\nsuch leadership. After all is said\nand done you get just what you\npay for. If you buy cheap shoes,\nyou get cheap shoes, if you buy\ngood shoes, you get good shoes.\nSo the politician who invests in\nthe \"south-before-the-war\" type\nof Negro with the expectation of\ngetting the masses will reap only\nin proportion to his investment.\nIn 1912 President William Ho\nward Taft made this statement\n\u201cI will appoint no Negroes to of\nfice in the South that will offend\nthe Southerners.\u201d Some political\nhistorians claim that this state\nment made by Senator Robert\nTaft's father was the beginning of\nbreaking the solid ranks of Negro\nvoters in the Republican party*\nUp to that time, the Negroes were\ndied-in-wool Republicans. To the\nNegro, as Frederick Douglas once\nsaid, \"The Republican Party is a\nship and all else is sea.\u201d During\nthose days, Roscoe Simmons could\nhold thousands of Negro voters\nspellbound with his eloquence and\nmatchless worl of praise for\n\"Abe.\" I was one of Roscoe\u2019s ad\nmirers. The picture has changed\nand it looks like the Republicans\nwill have to take on some of the\n\"New Day\" Negroes as leaders, if\nthey hope to get some votes which\nthey will need to elect Gen. Ike or\nwhoever they nominate. In order\nto win. they will need thousands\nof Negro votes in Illinois, New\nYork. Ohio, California, Missouri\nand everywhere else.\nlend replace your business partner\ni all right with n\nlaughter, if you\nlertaker.\" The\nmenta with t!\nSTAFF KINO VS. ANDtRSON\nStafford King, state auditor, has announced his candidacy for\nthe Republican nomination for governor. While King has staunch\nfriends throughout the state, it is highly doubtful that he will be\nable to wrest the nomination away from Governor C. Elmer Ander\nson. In 1948 King received a substantial vote when he tried for the\nnomination against Luther Youngdahl. To a great extent it was a\nprotest vote against Youngdahl. We doubt that opposition to Ander\nson, while it may exist, is of any such magnitude, and if King is\ncounting on a large protest vote this time he is due for a disappoint\nment. Anderson has made a good governor during the eight months\nsince he succeeded Youngdahl and he deserves nomination and elec\ntion in his own right.\u2014R.C.M. in The North STAR, Cambridge, Minn.\nWhat Is \"Normal\" Anyway?\nHow often do we hear folks these days say, \u201cWell, I wouldn't do\nthis or that, I\u2019d wait 'til things get more settled.\u201d\n\"Prices are too high, let's wait until things get cheaper.\u201d\n\u201cI'm not buying a new car this year\u2014 they'll be cheaper before\nlong.\u201d\nEtc., Etc\nIn other words we just don't think these are \"normal\" times. But\ndo you know that according to all statistics in all fields, \"normal\"\ntimes describes a condition that has not existed since 1914 and is not\nlikely to exist in the lifetime of anyone now living. Believe it or not,\nonly about half the people can recall conditions before 1941 and only\n30 per cent recall the depressions years from 1929 to 1934.\n\"Normal times\" existed in 1914, interesting, isn't it? 1916-1920\nwere war years. 1920-1928 were sort of inflationary years following\nthe war, then 1929, the big bust. Hard years from '29 to '34 began\nweening out in the late 30\u2019s.\nFrom 1940 to 1952 folks have been waiting and still are. They\ndon't think times are normal, but it's the longest expanse of time\nwe\u2019ve had like it and there doesn't seem to be any immediate\nchange in the offing.\nWe are in for abnormality, and must make the best of it, taking\nup each new day or year on its merits.\nAll man is asked to do is carry the load on this one day, solve the\nproblems of this one day and walk ahead as he should walk in the\npresent.

All of our\nmillions in handouts cannot stem the tide of socialism and communism.\nUnless we convince Europeans that democracy is an effective\nvital force for civic righteousness; unless we set the world a better\nexample of democracy than we have thus far; unless we make our\npractice square with our profession, sooner or later we shall lose\ncaste with the thinking European.\nEven today it Is difficult to estimate our favor In European eyes.\nThe hungry nations over there have an eye on our exchequer. It Is\nreally difficult to say where their love for us ends and their love for\nour dollar begins.\nIt is with nations as with men. wealthy men never know just who\ntheir real friends are. When there is weeping at the bedside of the poor\nuncle we know that the tears are genuine; but when there is weeping\nat the bedside of the rich kin, we are never sure of the depth of grief.\nSocialism came to England in such a substantial way that it is\ngoing to be difficult to eradicate. Fabian Socialists 50 years ago set\nabout innoculating Britain with the then fatuous notion of Socialism.\nThey decided not to go after it directly in the Marxist fashion, but\nlittle by little with a long time perspective.\nTheir tactics were labeled \u201cFabian\u201d after the Roman general,\nFabius, who was assigned the colossal task of heading off Hannibal,\nthe Carthlginian. who was out to subdue Italy. Fabius knew that his\narmy could not match that of Hannibal, so he hit upon the Idea of\nwaiting and vacillating and postponing the decisive day of battle.\nHis delaying tactics suggested to the early socialists in England\na strategy to winning England over to socialism. The Fabians, chief\namong whom was the late George Bernard Shaw, have won their fight.\nIt is only a matter of time, and their dream will have come true\nThe first socialist government in Britain was heralded as a po\nlitical accident. Great old Winston Churchhill exploited this idea and\nwon back in England a Tory government. But recent elections through\nout Britain indicate an early end of Churcrhill and his conservative\npolitical cohorts. And so it appears that the Tory government will\nsoon be replaced with another socialist government.\nWhen England goes socialist again It will be for keeps. The seeds\nsown by the Fabians during the last 50 years are ready for harvest, it\nis true we have poured our billions into British coffers: but it Is great\nly to lie feared that we have failed to stem the tide of socialism in\nEngland.\nJust as Germany got millions and millions after World War I\nfrom this country and finally went Nazi, so it appears that we are\ngoing to pay England not to go socialist but socialist England will\ngo sooner or later.\nIdeas must be combatted with ideas. Philosophies must be com\nbatted with philosophies. Ideas can no more be combatted with dollars\nthan they can with wars and rumors of wars.\nSocialism Is an idea just as communism, an \u201caggravated form of\nsocialism,\u201d la It Is going to take Ideas to combat these two potent\nrivals of our democracy.\nOf course if democracy at its very best were given a chance, it is\ndoubtful if any kind of ism could withstand it or threaten it; but the\nkind that the Dixiecrats are serving to the confused world is not\nrepresentative of the finer concepts of democracy.\nWhen our nation commits itself so bitterly against a program of\ncivil rights in the eyes of the world, it is no wonder that even our\nbillions cannot successfully combat socialism.\nThis writer is not nppsed to even a gigantic outlay of money to stem\nthe tide of communism; for how else can we defend our liberties in the\ngiven crisis? It is just that that makes this writer a non-complainer\nabout heavy taxes being levied by the nation. We must survive by all\nmeans and by all means the tide of communism must be stemmed.\nBut this does not subdue the bristling fact that unless our dollar\noutlay is accompanied by a moral outlay, we are fighting a losing\nbattle! Moral strength is still the greatest strength.\nWhen our moral strength matches our money strength, the Gates\nof Hell cannot prevail against us.\nThe minister believed in advertising.

Our chief contact in recent yeara\nwith \"our public\u201d was through the medium of the telephone and\nthrough infrequent speaking engagements which we have had to cut\nto a minimum.\nIncreasing telephone calls have caused us to have to limit our\nphone conversations also, because often one call takes all of 15 min\nutes.

This is well illustrated by an article in\nU. S. News and World Report describing\npresent government fiscal policies. It begins :\nReflation\u2014revived infation\u2014is to be sought\nby government from here on out. Deflation,\nmild and brief, has proved too much for the\nWhite House to accept without trying to\nbring a turn back toward inflation.\" Various\nstratagems will be employed\u2014if the Presi\ndent has his way\u2014in an effort to accomplish\nthis. To quote the News again, \"The ex\npressed hope is that, if the plan succeeds, it\nwill not result in a new inflation of prices.\nThe objective, instead, is an expanded use\nof credit.\" Mr. Truman's ideas on the sub\n- ject were expressed, in part, in his Midyear\nEconomic Report to Congress, and in his last\nradio talk to the nation. First of all, he is\nholding tenaciously to his belief in the wis\ndom of big spending, even though a deficit\nresults. For the current fiscal year, he wants\na budget of about $42,000,000,000 which, it\nis reliably estimated, will mean a govern\nment operating loss in excess of $5,000,\n000,000. He has, however, apparently chang\ned his mind on the $4,000,000,000 tax in\ncrease he formerly favored. Some think he\nwould even find tax decreases in certain\nfields acceptable. Sentiment in Congress\n.would seem to favor this. Not so long ago,\nthe White House backed a \"tight money\"\npolicy. Here, too, the President's stand seems\nentirely different now. Stock market mar\ngin requirements have been reduced. The\n|cont\u00a3ols on installment buying have been\nabandoned. Both the President and Con\ngress favor liberalized credit plans for new\nhousing! As the U. S. News sums it up,\nPolicies of government, basically, will be\naimed at stimulating a broader use of bor-\nrowed money, both by. Government itself and\njby private individuals and industiy. The\nlan to revive prosperity, the President pre\nicts, eventually will lead to a national in\n'come of $300,000,000,000.\" The President's\n(Council of Economic Advisers put the situ\n'ation in these words: \"The mere fact that\nthe Federal government is currently with\n.drawing well-over $40,000,000,000 a year\nfrom private-income channels and is dis\n44\n\u00abi\n?\nbursing a like or even greater amount into\nthe market and income stream means that\nthe government is already the most influen\ntial single factor in the current operation of\nthe economy.\nThe unanswered question is\nhow iong this kind of spending beyond in\ncome can be maintained without exhausting\n\u25a0 \u25a0\nIS TRUMAN'S PROGRAM WORKABLE?\nWhen, in his inaugural address, Presi\ndent Truman called for a \"bold new pro\ngram\" which would eventually banish \"him\nger, misery and despair\" from the free na\ntions of the world, the repercussions were\n? heard around the globe. The President spoke\nl in highly generalized terms and gave no\n'details. But it was clear to all that this was\na tremendous concept,, which would require\n.'many years to accomplish even in smaH part,\n; and that the problems and the costs would\n<be incredibly vast and complex. Since then,\n\u2022the program has been endlessly discussed,\nand from all sides. Some experts, who are\n\u00absympathetic with the President's humani\ntanan purpose, have come to the view that\nthe problems may be insoluble \u2014 and that\neven the desirability of the program is sub\nject to grave doubt.

If we mechanize and standardize\nhis work, change him from a creative artist\nto a machine tender, shall we be raising his\nstandard of living, and will he like it?\" Our\nidea of what civilization is, in other words,\nis not shared by everyone else.\nTHAT WICKED PROFIT MOTIVE\nThe present practical confiscation of pro\nfits stops the building of new capital, inter\nest in profits is killed, and wages, interest\nand dividends are knocked away. Actually,\nnot production, but production costs, are re\nwarded. The businessman is interested to\nraise, not lower costs in order to make the\nnet taxable revenue small, not large. Social\nist planning always shows its worst failures,\nnot in production figures, but in the price\nlevel. The enterpriser, exchanging profits\nfor security, in the form of fixed prices and\nsubsidies, stops caring about costs. A rigid\neconomy follows, in regard to all the ele\nments of production, which shows inelasti\ncity in responding to consumers' shifts. No\none can accuse Socalists of the wicked profit\nmotive. They genuinely desire the welfare\nof the masses. But this righteousness re\ngarding their own motives induces a pecu\nliarly irritating smugness, blinding them to\nthe fact that noble bureaucratic costs can\ngreatly exceed wicked profits, and that the\nwelfare of the masses has to demonstrate it\nself by facts, not theories. We are being\nurged to follow much the same path that\nBritain has chosen. A determined campaign\nis on to nationalize industry, as in the case\nof light and power. An equally determined\ncampaign would have us accept a compul\nsory health insurance scheme that differs\nonly in detail from England's enormously\ncostly experiment in this field. The advocates\nof cradle-to-the-grave * security\u2014at a cost\nwhich no one can estimate\u2014are beating the\ndrums throughout the land. And, in spite\nof the tremendous burden of taxation that\nstifles our initiative, no real effort has been\nmade to cut the cost of government. Every\nsocialist or communist proposal is based\non the appealing fiction that by eliminating\nprofit we will advance the welfare of the\nmasses. Yet, in every case, precisely the\nopposite result has been achieved. It is not\nan accident that our high wages and high\nliving standards have been gained under the\nprofit system. The system has its faults\u2014\nbut socialism, as the record proves, has in\nfinitely more and some of them are beyond\ncorrection.\nnM ctttp\n. UiNljY A blEP\nA distinct departure in the Federal power\npolicy is embodied irua report of the Senate\nCommittee on Appropriations. The report\ndisapproved proposed appropriations for\nconstructing government power facilities in\nfour parts of the country. It did this on the\nassumption that local electric utilities could\nand would achieve the same results, without\nwasteful duplication of facilities, under con\ntracts with the government. These contracts\nw'ould be patterned after a time-tested con\ntract which exists between the Southwestern\nPower Administration and a Texas utility,\nThe contract in question is naturally techni\ncal * n its wording. Its basic principles, how\n\u00c7 ver \u00bb can be simply described. First of all,\nit permits the Federal plants to carry out\nthe mandate of Congress, and to serve their\n'preference customers\" without duplicating\nexisting power lines. Second, it permits the\nPrivate company to develop its service area\nwithout being constantly threatened by sub\nsidized tax-exempt government competition.\nThus, it stops the vicious cycle under which\nthe menace of unmeetable, socialistic com\npetition alarms investors; their alarm pre\nvents a company from raising the money it\nneeds to meet the growing demand in its reg\nion, and, finally, this situation is used as\nargument for putting the government deep\ner into the power business, at a huge cost to\nthe general taxpayers. The Senate commit\nb\u00c2\u00cf\u00cfj\u00ce is on^ya step\" \u00c4to\u00c4\nto have been received with hysterical bor\nror by those who want socialized power re\ngardless of the cost or the need or the justice\nof the matter. They are mobilizing all their\nforces in an attempt to force through the\nproposed appropriations \u2014 along with\nlengthy list of other measures whose whole\nintent is to destroy private enterprise and\nlocal authority in the electrical field. The\npublic, which pays the bill, must understand\nwhat is going on, because it will pay for\nan\nin needless taxes.\nNOW COMES THE RECESSION\nUnfortunately, jobs are disappearing,\nPrices have come down. There seems to be\nmore difficulty right now than ever before\nto bring about compromises between strik\ners and employers. Labor union bosses are\ncarrying on plans that an outsider might\nthink indicates enmity towards the Ameri\ncan industrial system. Just why the labor\nbosses and industrial managers have to fight\ntheir battles to a finish doesn't seem to make\nsense. The federal government has enacted\nlabor laws for the adjustment of all differ\nences between employers and employees.\nLet's use them! The Taft-Hartley law has\nbeen repeatedly upheld by Congress\u2014which\nhas taken a broad vision and is playing fair\nwith everybody. But in recent months CIO\norganizations have added new demands\ntheir Programs. They claim the rights\nemployees to pensions, fixed at $150 a month\nfor all superannuated workers. The CIO ar\ngues that pensions are wages deferred and\na are therefore a legitimate charge on indus\ntry. Steel workers have asked for health,\nl\u00ae liability, life and disability expansion on\nbig scale. And so the fights between work\nif ers and employers are becoming more and\nmore like political issues. And right now\na the Democratic and Republican parties are\nsplit in every possible way. The leaders\nboth of these parties do not know whether\nthey are going or coming.

Money spent by par\nents thereon Is well invested.\nBut I do notice one thing with\nmy grandchildren.\nWHAT ABOUT SUMMER\nCAMPS\nThe first summer when they\nare home alone, after being too\nold for camp, they are \"lost\"\nand know not what to do. Dur\ning previous summers while at\nRoger W. Babson camp, every hour of the day\nwas planned for them; they\nmerely followed their camp counsellors and the\nother children. After outgrowing camp life and left\nto themselves, they appear helpless and bored, while\nchildren who never went to camp and lacked the\nmany camp advantages are much happier.\nThe above does not mean we should deprive our\nchildren of camp life: but it does mean that camp\nowners should overcome this drawback. This\nrection is even more important in connection with\nthe recreational programs which cities and towns\nare now putting on for children. Certain mornings\neach week I see a class of children following, like\nlittle soldiers, a teacher to the beach or a play\nground. They\u2014like the camp children\u2014are having\ntheir days planned for l,hem during the\ncation as well as during the school terms. As these\nchildren will be entirely \"on their own\" after grad\nuating from school and going to work, it seems only\nreasonable to let them take care of themselves for\ntwo months each year so as to get used to Indi\nvidual responsibility.\nLABOR LEADERS AND POLITICIANS\nCei tainly our public schools are not developing\nindividual res^nsiblllty. Young people have'too\nmuch given to them and are taught to \"follow their\nleader\" from birth until they get their first job.\n1 herefore, it is natural that they will want a labor\nleader and ward politician to follow when they\nto work. Certainly, our schools are making follow\ners for the labor leaders.

If I want to hire\nof my grandchildren for running errands in the\noffice or working on the grounds inside, I must get\nvarious papers signed by the State and/or School\nAuthorities,\u2014 provided they will sign them! The\nwhole present system is wrong. Many children could\nacquire valuable habits and knowledge by summer\nwork at almost any age. I worked for wages every\nvacation after I was twelve years old and the\nperience was of great value. It is a crime to rob\nchildren of this privilege today. Again I say we\nare undermining democracy and individual respon\nsibility by so doing.\nHOW A UTOPIA WILL COME\nI recently established a college in the center of\nthe U.

But\nnone are agreed on a program to\ntake its place. Out of the maze of\nperplexity has come a dozen farm\nbills\u2014the Pace bill, the Cooley bill,\nthe Gore bill, the Thomas bill and\nmany others until one farm leader\nremarked\u2014\"Everybody wants to\nget into the act.\n_ _\nj,. Fa K r T m . Bur eau Federation\nand the National Grange are in\nxsagreement and are backing dif\nferent proposals, and both get back\nto the defensive statement that\n\"the farmers don't want the Bran\nnan plan.\" The National Farmers\nUnion favors the Brannan plan. At\nexplosive hearings before both\nsenate and house committees, the\nfarm leadership marshalled its\nforces bringing into Washington\nleaders from throughout the coun\ntry to testify against the Brannan\nplan. Red-hot statements have been\nissued.\n>>\nThe Farm Bureau, usually\neven-tempered and conserva\ntive, issued a release called\n\u00ab\nWashington Ringside,\nques~\ntioning the sincerity, the mo\ntives, and insofar as this re\nporter can Judge, even the ver\nacity of the secretary of agri\nculture. And in so doing the\nFarm Bureau went back to the\n1948 campaign issue of grain\nstorage, taken away from the\nCCC by the 80th congress. This\ncongress has written into the\nlaw again the authority of CCC\nto again provide storage for\ncommodity credit grain on\n' loan or purchase.\nOne thing is certain the whole\nquestion of an agricultural pro\ngram will be a major issue in the\n1950 campaign and the Farm Bu\nreau was the first to take off the\ngloves and make its fight against\nSecretary Brannan and President\nTruman, who also called for en\nactment of the Brannan plan in\nhis message to congress, on a\nstrictly political basis.\nAnother thing is certain. The\nHope-Aiken law, with its so-called\nflexible provision of 60 to 90 per\ncent of parity, either will be re\nplaced by another law, or will be\nso amended as to be unrecogniza\nble. So blistering has been the heat\nturned on the Aiken law that even\nSenator Aiken himself* now says\nthat anything called for in the\nBrannan plan can be done under\nhis law and easier, too . . . with\nout going before congress for an\nannual appropriation for direct\nsubsidy payments to farmers.\nSenator Aiken now also\ndenies that price support under\nhis law was ever intended to be\noperated on a sliding scale,\nthat prices should be supported\nat 90 per cent of parity the\nsame as now; that the sliding\nscale was put in merely to pro\ntect the farmer against sup\nports being dropped by admin\nistrative action below a cer\ntain point.\nThe National Council of Farm\nCooperatives after issuing a state\nment that it generally was opposed\nto direct subsidies as proposed by\nthe Brannan plan, has subsided\nsomewhat and is riding out the\nstorm, mainly for the reason that\nsome cooperatives want the provi\nsions of the Brannan plan.\nMr. Allan Kline, president of the\nFarm Bureau federation, who is\nan Iowa Republican, and was men\ntioned prominently during the last\npresidential campaign as a prob\nable choice of Gov. Dewey for\nsecretary of agriculture, has been\nthe most outspoken opponent of the\nBrannan plan, and Mr. Brannan\nlevelled some rather caustic criti\ncism at Mr. Kline during Bran\nnan's appearance before a senate\nagriculture committee hearing. The\nFarm Bureau declares that under\nthe Brannan proposal,\nhope for a fair income (for farm\ners) would depend on government\nhand-outs from annual appropria\ntions by congress.\" That refers of\ncourse to the direct subsidy of\ncompensatory payments provided\nfor under the Brannan proposal\nand the fact these payments would\ncome from the federal treasury.\nThe question naturally arises\nto whether anyone is naive enough\nto believe that the present subsidy\nof price support payments comes\nfrom any place except the federal\ntreasury. Another question natural\nly arises. If the farmers them\nselves don't want the Brannan\nplan, why all the shooting?\n* * *\nThe Pace bill, introduced by\nCongressman Stephen Pace of\nGeorgia, virtually kills the 1948\nagricultural act (Hope-Aiken law)\nand contains the important fea\ntures of the Brannan plan.\nthe only\nas\n-<to\nAncient Grape Vines\nStill Grow\nRALEIGH, N.

We must\nknow definitely whether we are to\ncontinue on the private enter\nprise, profit system, or to follow\nsome form of socialism that has\nengulfed practically all other na\ntions of the world.\nWhat we may call such a\nsystem, whether socialism, na\ntionalization, comma n i s m,\nfascism or human welfare. Is\nof small moment. All of such\nrepresent \u00bbgovernment plan\nnln g, government operation,\nregimentation and an army of\ngovernmental bureaucrats to\n^ pa ja.\nIf our Private enterprise, profit\n\u00aey stern \u00ab continue, it calls for a\ncontinuous flow of new capital into\nindustry, transportation, finance,\n' utilities, merchandising, all of\nwbicb represents business, big and\nThat new capital is not. and\nwiU not be > forthcoming so long as\ntbe * ear of socialism continues to\nexist in the American mind, de\nspite the fact that the savings of\nthe American people, represented\nby cash or its equivalent, is larger\nto-day than at any time of our na\ntional history. The people are nob\ninvesting their savings, and will\nnot, so long as they fear the tak\ning over of business by a socialized\ngovernment.\nIn his public addresses,\nother than some of a purely\npartisan character. President\nTruman lauds the private en\nterprise system, and insists it\nmust continue. In some parti\nsan political addresses, and in\nmost of his demands for legis\nlation, he turns quite definitely\nto the left, and if congress\nenacted the demanded legisla\ntion\u2014as is always possible that\nIt may\u2014we would be embarked\non a socialistic road, regard\nless of the name it might be\ngiven. ;\nNEEDS most\ni\ni \\\nPersonally, I am convinced that\nhis public, non-pattisan addresses\nrepresent the president's lean\nings, that he is for private enter\nprise; that his partisan addresses,\nand his demands on congress for\nlegislation that would lead to\nsocialism are the products of\nsocialisticly inclined theorists em\nployed as presidential advisors. So\nlong as that situation exists there\nwill be a doubt in the minds of the\nAmerican people, and they will\nhold onto their savings, and not put\nit to work in American business.\nTo-day we do not need to accept\ntheories. There is an abundance of\nopportunity to secure the facts as\nto the operation of socialism as a\nnational policy. The best source of\nsuch factual information is Eng\nland. She could tell us in definite\nterms of what socialism has ac\ncomplished for her people.\nSome may guess at the result,\nbut guesses do not dispel fears, or\nchange the thinking or the efforts\nof the theorists. What we want on\nwhich to make a decision for the\nfuture is definite and factual in\nformation secured by those who\nare interested only in the best in\nterests of the American people as\na whole. We do not want to seek\nmerely proof of a theory, and the\npeople would not accept as con\nclusive any findings presented by\na group of socialistic theorists.\nThe president could name \u00bb\ncommission instructed to re\nport on what has been accom\nplished under a socialistic sys\ntem in England. Such a com\nmission, whose findings would\nbe acceptable to all the Ameri\ncan people, should consist\nof men of the type of\nBernard Baruch, Herbert\nHoover, William Jeffries, and\nothers of that class. Their state\nments would be accepted as\nmeaning what is best for all\nthe American people and not\nmade for the purpose of either\nproving or disproving a theory.\nThen, and then only, can there be\na definite decision as to our eco\nnomic course. Such a decision\nshould, and would, stop the weasel\nwords that befuddle us to-day.\nSome may not like the decision,\nwhatever it may be, but it will be\ndefinite, and we could plan for the\nfuture, which we cannot do so\nlong as the surreptitious effort to\nchange us over to the socialistic\nroad continues.\nIf we are to forsake the ways of\nthe past, and adopt socialism as\nan economic system let us do so\nopenly and honestly, not through\nthe back alleys of deceit. If we are\nto continue on the private enter\nprise, profit system, let it be\nknown and so remove fear.\nj\nUnder the present wasteful and\ncumbersome governmental system\nof purchasing it costs more to\nbuy $10 worth of lead pencils than\nthe price of the pencils.

A. BETZ, RAY BROOKES\n^JAMM SLAVEN, OSCAR SWAN, k0SE STEWART\nSigns Of The Times\nThe American Federation of Labor has a staff of ex\npert statisticians and economists back in Washington, D. C.\nThis staff puts in its time studying facts about business and\nindustry and Labor. It delves into the most reliable figures\nin the nation and it comes up with facts.\ni,. For instance: Unemployment is steadily increasing, in\nspite of what you read in the papers. Thus far in 1950, two\nmillion more people have been jobless than during the cor\nresponding months of 1947 and 1948. The number of areas\nreporting 12 percent of their labor force out of work has in\ncreased from 39 in December, 1949, to 43. In more than half\nof the important 'industrial centers of the country from\nsettfi to 12 percent of the labor force is jobless and only a\nvery small part of this unemployment is seasonable.\nThat is not good news, but it is a fact, and intelligent\npeople will do some heavy thinking about it. For, if the trend\ncontinues\u2014and industry is doing nothing to stop it\u2014we are\nheaded for another depression. If responsible groups will\nact now, the trend can be stopped and within 12 months\nthere will be jobs for all who want to work. If they fail to\nact, a year from today will see another million added to the\npresent more than five million without jobs.\nThen we will have, of course, large outpourings of gov\nernment money, most of it for unplanned and unpermanent\njobs. We will have much waste, and not a little stealing. All\nof which is to be expected when we let our blundering lead us\ninto an economic impasse.\nThe American Federation of Labor proposes a coopera\ntive approach to the problem of unemployment. It suggests\ncommittees representing Labor, management, finance, the\nchurch, and sectors of our economic life, to study the prob\n9\nJem and hunt for the answers.\nFull Employment Committees composed of voters, just\nordinary run-of-the-mill people in various walks of life, can\ndo a better job right now than can the politicians. After all,\nunemployment is a community problem, too.\n\u25a0'4'\nM. Duffy. P. O. Box 762, East Liverpool, Ohio\nf|Mt Vke L. Wheatley, Room 216, Broad Street, National Bank Build,\nin*.

Ac\ncording to news reports, both the AFL and the CIO have\npledged support to a corporation which aims to build some\n18,000 homes in the new commonwealth. Part of the neces\nsary capital will be raised in the United States through the\nsale of $10,000,000 worth of bonds. The garment workers\u2019\nunions have already announced that they expect to purchase\nla substantial portion of these bonds.\nThe enterprise, headed by New York union leaders and\nindustrialists, is a heart-warming example of intehiational\ncooperation and enlightened self-interest. No only does it\npromise to alleviate one of the most pressing problems of the\n\u2018young state, but it offers a profitable investment outlet. It\ntestifies to the growing realization among unionists that\norganized labor must adapt realistic business policies that\nunions can no longer disregard the financial needs of indus\ntrial enterprise on which the welfare and security of their\nmembership depends.\nLabor\u2019s venture in far-off Israel is a step in the right\ndirection. The next task is to investigate possibilities closer\nto home and to make part of its substantial resources avail\nable for industrial investments in America. By doing so\nunions will add to their strength, enhance the well-being of\nthe nation and contribute to the growth of our free enter\nprise system.\nHow A Committee Helped\nLatest unemployment figures from government agencies\nshow improvement, with over 500,000 persons going off the\nunemployment rolls in March. The outlook, however, while\nsomewhat brighter, does not do away with the need for or\nganization of local full employment committees, as urged by\nthe American Federation of Labor. That such committees\nget results was shown by the federation in its \u201cLabor\u2019s\nMonthly Survey,\u201d which cited stories from the experiences\nof committees already at work. Here is one example:\nIn an eastern town, a member of the local Carpenter\u2019s\nUnion is a leader on the full employment committee. The\ntown needed housing for low income families many local\nworkers needed jobs. The AFL member got necessary in\nformation about applying for loans under the Housing Act\nof 1949, then with his fellow committee members went in\nperson to the agencies involved in clearing the loan, followed\nit step by step, speeding the process until a loan of $60,000\nwas granted. Workers will soon be busy constructing a new\nlow cost housing project. He did not stop there. He and\nother committee members are expediting other projects to\nincrease employment. For instance, they are working to se\ncure funds for completion of a dam which will furnish water\nto a nearby pulp mil), enabling it to take on several hundred\nmore workers.\nOther committees, the AFL says, have been successful\nin getting state and local projects underway for highway\nconstruction, extension of a sewer system, building of schools\nand hospitals, increasing the teaching staff in public schools,\nimproving post offices and pther public services by adding\nneeded workers.\nOnly Unity Can Win\nfree workers stand together. American workers support the\nEuropean Recovery Program, the Atlantic Pact and the Mili\ntary Defense Assistance Program because these are peace\nmeasures and the expression of our sense of solidarity with\nfree peoples of other lands.\nFrom the end of World War I to the violent seizure of\npower first by Lenin, then by Mussolini and later by Hitler,\nthe Communists of Italy and Germany contributed greatly\nto the chaos, confusion and the disunity of the labor move\nment which paved the way for Fascism and Nazism. Since\nthe end of World War II the Communists have tried to create\nthe conditions that will pave the way for their form of totali\ntarianism. Having failed to wreck the Marshall Plan, they\nare now engaged in a desperate drive to sabotage the mili\ntary defenses of countries menaced by Soviet imperialism.\nMinimum Wage Farce\nThe so-called state minimum wage is little short of a\nfarce and a fraud. The law says' that such a wage shall be\nfixed lor certain workers, women and children, and that it\nshall not be below the wage necessary for health and de\ncency. A state board sets the wage, and then permits a flock\nof employers to pay \u201capprentices\u201d and youngsters less than\nthe minimum. The board\u2019s theory, we suppose, is that wo\nmen and children who are apprentices do not require healthy\nand decent wages, but should get along on less.\nBut why worry about government\u2019s fumbling with wage\nproblems. If you wait for government to act, you\u2019il wait for\never. The only hope of the working people is their Labor\nUnions. When strong Unions produce gains for their mem\nliers and establish better living standards, the politicians\nlimp along, much later, and pass some laws. But the Unions\nmust act first.\nCoudert Would Save The Republic\nIn the back of the \u201cCongressional Record\u201d we find some\nimpassioned remarks by Hon. Frederic R. Coudert, Jr., a\nTaft-Republican member of Congress from New York. Mr.\nCoudert wishes to save the American republic. How does he\npropose to do it?\nWhy, it\u2019s the simplest thing in thp world. Amend our\nincome tax law so it can only be used to pay off the national\ndebt and the interest thereon and to meet war emergencies.\nMr. Coudert says our income tax law \u201cis destroying the\nincentive and hope of the American citizen.\u201d We haven\u2019t\nnoticed such loss of incentive. At the moment Americans\nseem to be doing pretty well.\nOf course, taxes are high, but Americans have money to\npay taxes now. It was different in the days of the \u201cHoover\nhunger.\u201d Now, after paying all our taxes, we have about\nthree times as much left as w\u00a3 had in those bad days.\nMr. Coudert\u2019s proposal will be received with loud cheers\nby certain rich men, already rolling in wealth but anxious to\nget more.\nBillion Dollar Preseht\nCongress is getting ready to pass out a billion dollar\npresent. No, it isn\u2019t for the working people. It isn\u2019t going to\nbe in the form of an increase in income tax exemptions for\nthose who have to toil for tjieir living. Nothing like that!\nYet, there is glee in some quarters.\nThe present is going to the fur coat trade, the diamond\nand gem trade, the folks who have the most luxuries. It is to\nbe in the form of a tax cut on luxuries such as mink coats\nand diamonds, and stuff like that there.

CARTER\nFor Labor Press Association\nWashington (LPA)\u2014With the primaries coming even nearer, the\nRepublican confusion over their \u201csales talk\u201d to the voters grows more\nconfounded. They have been casting around for a winning slogan for\na long time now, and though they had come up with one when they un\nfurled the \u201cLiberty versus Socialism\u201d banner in a party policy state\nment on the eve of their big shindig in Washington Feb. 6.\nThey had tried \u201cstatism\u201d, and th^ voters refused to get scared.\nThey had tried \u201cwelfare state\u201d, and the Lehman-Dulles contest\njnNew York, that flopped.\nThey had been bleating about the \u201chandout state\u201d, concentrating\ntheir fire on social welfare programs. Those, they said, were \u201chand\nouts\u201d. They were silent on the subsidies to big business, which of\ncourse, are not \u201chandouts\u201d. That failed.\nSo they trotted out \u201cLiberty versus Socialism.\u201d That was so ab\nsurd that even their own party members rebelled. Papers by no means\nfriendly to the Fair Deal pointed to the idiocy of calling the program\nor President Truman socialist.\nThe critics within the party not only complained about making\n\u201csocialism\u201d the issue, but complained of the vagueness of other planks,\nthe omissions, the pussy footing and of the length of the policy state\nment.\nSen. Margaret Chase Smith, Maine, one of those dismayed by the\noriginal statement, suggested that a digest of the platform be pre\npared. It was, under direction of Sen. Owen Brewster, Maine, chair\nman of the Republican Senatorial Committee, and Rep. Leonard W.\nH.all, New York, chairman of the House Republican committee.\nThe digest, approved by the party\u2019s national committee, makes 10\npoints. And where is the \u201cLiberty versus Socialism\u201d plank?\nIt\u2019s No. 10. It reads': \u201cSafeguarding liberty against socialism,\u201d\nNa 1 is now tax reduction, and No. 2 is balancing the budget.\n... 'The shift in emphasis did not bring peace to the GOP. Although\nthe news release with the digest said that Republican candidates are\nexpected to incorporate the digest into their campaign pamphlets,\n'Senator Robert Taft, Ohio, immediately roared that the digest \u201chas\nno official standing whatsoever\u201d, and that \u201cnobody was consulted about\nthis except the campaign committees\u201d. Told that the digest had been\nprepared whh the.cooperationi of GOP national chairman^Guy Gabriel-\nson, Taft still said the statement was unofficial and that no switch\nis emphasis could be construed.\nAnd Gabrielson, two days later, asserted \u201csocialism\u201d is still the\nmijor issue. He still declared his \u201cdeep concern\u201d over the \u201cschemes\nin Washington which have us drifting down the road to socialism\u201d.\nThe progressives among the Republicans are no more pleased by\nthe digest than by the original statement. Said Sen. Irving M. Ives,\nNew York: \u201cI still think we should specifically indorse fair employ\nment practices and other civil rights legislation and state just what\nkind of a labor-management relations act we favor.\u201d Said Rep. Jacob\nK. Javits, New York: \u201cIt certainly should have found room for the\nRepublican position on civil rights and FEPC\u201d. And Sen. Henry Cabot\nLodge, Jr., Massachusetts, in criticizing the original longer statement\nhad warned that the \u201cLiberty versus Socialism\u201d slogan would not\nmake many votes for the Republicans.\nBut the chief trouble with the original statement, and with the\ndigest, and with all the various blasts by the Republicans was point*d\nmt by Rep. James G. Fulton, Pennsylvania, in his criticism of the\noriginal statement. He said it ignored the fundamental division with\nthe party: Whether we go back to Methusaleh or offer alternative pro\ngrams of social progress within the framework of a balanced budget.\u201d\nThe GOP high command, despite dissident voices within its ranks,\nstill wants to \u201cgo back to Methusaleh.\u201d\nThe people of this nation do not.\nWHAT DOES STALIN WANT?\nBy RUTH TAYLOR\nArc we interested in knowing how we may please Stalin?

She threw a party for the 88 masons, carpenters and\npainters who helped get the new embassy ready. As the men started\nto Leave they broke a window pane\u2014and then hastened to explain that\nDanish workers always do that at a housewarming as a token of ap\npreciation for a swell party!\n\u2014In New York City, members of AFL Painters District 0 drum\nmed up a thriving business for themselves when they passed out leaf\nlets informing apartment house tenants that under new regulations\nissued by the regional housing expeditor landlords must paint apart\nments at least every two years.\n\u2014In Sidney, Australia, Harry Fulton won a $10 bet, and was\nmade an honorary member of the brewery workers union, after he\ngulped down 60 imperial half pints (more than four and one-half Am\nerican gallons) of beer between 10 a. m. and 6 p. m. the legal bar\nhours.\n\u2014In Algiers, where the skin of live camels must be patched up\nbecause it does not heal like the hides of other animals, 123 camel\ncaretakers went on strike for a raise of 10c per patch.\n\u2014In Baltimore, the regional office of the U.

During a hearing before the Senate-House\nEconomic Committee, Senator Flanders declared, \u201cI think Senators and\nRepresentatives would do a better job if they worked a 40-hour week.\u201d\n\u2014In New York City, it was figured up that the trial of the 11 top\nCommunists cost the government $128,000, which proved the Commun\nist thesis that Capitalism wastes the taxpayers\u2019 money.\n\u2014In Jackson, Mississippi, it was reported that Republican big\nwigs had again approached two top Dixiecrat leaders on the idea of\ncombining the two parties. The two Dixiecrats were Gov. Fielding\nWright, States Rights candidate for vice-president, in 1948, and W. W.\nWright, Mississippi representative on the Dixiecrat national executive\ncommittee. Which proved conclusively that two Wrights can make one\nwrong.\n\u2014In Tokyo, union leaders who had urged abolition of the mon\narchy saw a step in the right direction in the fact that Emperor Hiro\nhito\u2019s 20-year-old daughter became engaged to a clerk earning $5 a\nweek.\n\u2014In Washington, it was disclosed that 345 newspaper editors\nwere asked \u201cDo you feel that the Republican Party has a program that\ncan compete politically with Truman\u2019s Fair Deal?\u201d and that 91% of\nthe editors had answered \u201cNo.\u201d Then all 345 editors went back to writ\ning editorials proclaiming that the GOP program is far superior to the\nDemocrats\u2019.\n\u2014In Chicago, a report made by Carl B.

Curley, who was defeated, reported that\nhis campaign expenditures amounted to $186,160\u2014more than $1.50 a\nvote!\n\u2014In Oslo, Norway, union taxi drivers became more devoted to V\ntheir labor government than ever before when authorities confiscated\n73 expensive foreign cars that directors of Norwegian export-import\nfirms had been given by American corporations.\n\u2014In Longenton, England, labor relations experts who long be\nlieved that workers in routine jobs were bored and unhappy admitted\nthey have been crossed up by the findings of a committee set up by\nthe Ministry of National Insurance.

Turn down the middle income cooperative housing bill and the\nAdministration\u2019s aid-to-education bill.\n2. Approve legislation that would allow the natural gas companies\nto take billions of dollars in unjustified profits from consumers.\n3. Let Senator McCarthy and other isolationist Republicans (fo\nalmost unchallenged in one of the most vicious smear campaigns in\nAmerican history.\nAt the ADA convention the bedraggled Congressional liberals\nfound hundreds of men and women from all over the country, repre\nsenting thousands of others at home, fighting mad at what had been\nhappening in Congress, and anxious to work for the defeat of the Me\nCarthys in Congress.\nThen was no sign of defeatism among the ADAers. They were\nready and anxious for a new offensive against the conservatives in\nCongress. In a series of swift votes, with little division, the ADA laid\nout its program and prepared for the political battle just ahead\u2014|n\nthis year\u2019s elections.\nOn top of everything else there was a speech from Eleanor Roose\nvelt, which few who heard it will ever forget. Calling for those with\nconvictions to stand up and fight for them, Mrs. Roosevelt said:\n\u201cThere is a sense of insecurity, almost fear, among many people\ntoday. Some people fear the possibility of war. Others fear what the\nnew weapons of war might mean. With others, it is a fear of what\nmay happen to them personally if they offend in any way. That is\nthe fear that concerns me most\u2014the fear to stand up for convictions.\nThat fear can hurt our democracy more than any other.\n\u201cTcwjay it takes the kind of courage it took in the early days of\nour history to stand up for our convictions. At present we need all the\ncourage our forefathers had and maybe more\u2014because we have a job\nto do at home. We have to be unafraid. Here is where we as indivi\nduals have to fulfill our faith in democracy.,1*17.\n\u201cIf wo can not have confidence in\nwe are all trying to retain the best in our democracy if we cannot\nfind some basic unity in time of peace, then we are never going to be\nable to actually lead the world\u2014which is the job before us today.\n\u201cIf we are not to lead the world, who is? It\u2019s what we do here\nthat makes us fit to lead the world. Our problem is to prove to\nthe world that democracy has more to offer than communism. We have\nto face the fact that this is a struggle and a great struggle.\u201d\nMrs. Roosevelt added that one of the most important things we\nmust do to prove to the world that our system is best is to protect civil\nrights. She said our domestic civil rights program had become of great\nimportance internationally.' Nor can we ignore unemployment, or in\njustice of any kind, she said. One of the answers to the unemployment\nproblem, Mrs. Rodseveit added, \"may be in backing up the United Na\ntions through the Point Four program of President Truman\u2019s.\n\u201cIt seems to me,\u201d she said, \u201cthat ADA is an organization that has\nthinking people in it, and we must preserve the right to think and dif\nfer. We must be able to disagree with people and consider new ideas\nwithout being afraid. The day we are afraid to sit down in the same\nroom with someone because five years from now someone may say we\nsat in the room with a communist\u2014that day will be a bad day.\u201d\n\"V\nThursday, April 13, 1950\neach other\u2014that fundamentally 1\nn our democracy\u2014if we cannot\"\nk"}, {"title": "detroit evening times.", "city": ["Detroit"], "date": "19451027", "raw_text": "Kirn I liiM ame preAidenl if %% \u00ab\u2022\u00ab p\u00ab*r\nftMilv ji|\u00bb|ijir4 k tU Iliaf lln* li*\u00bbv liv which the\nwn v coulfl lie opcncil so uni lon ill progress\nManila Hemp\nMEWS NOT\u00a3 : - '\nCINEP\u00bbI k>\u00abapihub - -V*-r\nFAVOCIIXICUTIOHOF I ;.>*< VjSk\nTAP WAC Cl?iM\u2018N AtC OH 1 l -V t.\nTHI GMIOWT RATMtP TUAN i\nTH| PIPING SOUAD ME OOU\nNCTT COHSIDIP GtHIRALS \\\nVAMASVMTA AND MOMMA i J\nAt WAR PC'SONtR 81/T *\\\n'T'HE papal message addressed to\n* women throughout the world, and\nsummoning them to faithful and\nresolute performance of their holy\nduty as the mothers of mankind, is\nnot for the Catholic women of the\nworld alone, although specifically ad*\ndressed to them.\nThis stirring spiritual appeal, in\naccordance with the moral pattern\nPope Pius consistently follows in\nurging a wholesome and peaceful\nway of life upon the nations of the\nworld, is for the enlightenment and\ninstruction of ALL women.\n\u201cEvery woman WITHOUT EX\nCEPTION,\u201d he said, \u201chas \u2014 and un\nderstands it clearly\u2014the duty, the\nABSOLUTE DUTY OF CON\nSCIENCE, to enter into action ac\ncording to the possibilities of each,\nTO CONTAIN THE CURRENTS\nMENACING THE HEARTH , to\nCOMBAT DOCTRINES UNDER\nMINING ITS FOUNDATIONS, and\nto prepare to organize for accom\nplishment of its restoration .\u201d\n* * *\nT\u2019HE Pope\u2019s great purpose is to re\n* store and strengthen, to exalt and\npurify, the essential human institu\ntions of church and home and family.\nHis AUTHORITY is that of the\nhead of a single church.\nBut his CONCERN is for the\nspiritual and moral welfare and dig\nnity and integrity of all mankind.\nHis INFLUENCE is universal.\nHis AIM is for a clean and good\nworld, and his HOPE for its attain\nment rests weightily upon the women\nof the world to whom his current\nappeal is addressed.\nThe things to which the Pope\naspires in behalf of humanity are the\nvital things for which all women\nyearn\u2014peace, liberty and productive\nhappiness.\nThese are the things, as he said,\nUpon which \" the church , family and\nhome are based.''\nKnowledge Test\nBt PR.

He is supported by most of the top pro\nfessionals in the party and they are a ruthless, no-holds barred\ngroup as has been proven by his Texas and Louisiana delegate\nfight.\nEisenhower\u2019s supporters, aside from a few are the newer\nfigure* In the national party circles and the younger members\nof the party who are considered GUI\u2019 liberals. They have not\nhad the experience found in the Taft camp.

No blood ran and thousands of Negroes enrolled ns\nvoters to cast ballots for the candidate of their preference Taft,\nin our humble opinion, has no feeling for the V. M. minorities\nany more than he has for the U. M. working man.\nEisenhower's civil rights stand might be excused on the\ngrounds that upon his return to America he was expected to\ngive his views on such an imposing variety of issues that hr\ncould not be expected to do very good on all of them. Cer\ntainly, since the civil rights issue is going to plague any candi\ndate, \u2018'lke\" should have had some advice from topflight Ne\ngro leaders, not necessarily Negro political lenders, but those\nselfless lenders who nre noxious that each of the two parties\nput up the best man for president within their party rank*\nFrom Eisenhower\u2019s inept handling of the civil rights issue and\nthe question of a Negro for the cabinet you could see that hr\nhas not takrn time to lie informed.\nHim answers to ninny other quest ions also in<liente<l thnt\nhe must have <lev<>te<l niont of his time in recent tmnilhK as\nSupreme t'ommnmler in Europe to the job at hand, mid not to\nhi* impending campaign for the Itepiiblienn nomination Thia\nin to hi* credit, but doea not register with the voters who are\napt to eonnider that his insufficient, wandering answer* are\nsigns of weakness rather than n lack of time to thoughtfully\nconsider the issue*. which \"Ike\" certainly did not have in\nEurope.\nIt\u2019s going to be quite some battle for supremacy in Chicago\nwhen the (hand Old Party gets together to nominate a candi\ndate.

Harold in his best days had not the vigor of mind,\nthe vibrant personality of Humphrey. Harold has had his try\nand has apparently failed to gain his much desired objective.\nNow Minnesota may offer the nation Humphrey who has more\nplatform appeal and general nil around statesmanship than\nany candidate in the field of either party.\nThe above is probably some wishful thinking on our part\nfor in r. l >2. since it is apparent that Humphrey himself is not\nyet aeriousl.' considering entering the race despite his Minne\nsota favorite, son status We hope he does not run for vice\npresident.

Friday, June 27, 1962\nPUBLISHERS CORNER\nOur biggest bang since becoming a desk slave is to get out at a\npublic occasion where we can renew personal contact with our readers.\nOnly a few years ago we were on chummy terms with practically\nevery subscriber\u2014for we collected the yearly subscriptions from\ndoor to door, house to house\nThis close- contact ended when circulation grew and grew and it\nwas necessary to stay close to the office, to more or less direct the\nweekly production of this paper. Our chief contact in recent years\nwith \"our public\" was through the medium of the telephone and\nthrough infrequent speaking engagements which we have had to cut\nto a minimum\nIncreasing telephone calls have caused us to have to limit our\nphone conversations also, because often one call takes all of 15 min\nutes. Then, too, your correspondent himself likes fo gab and has not\nlearned the fine art of limiting phone conversations like, for example.\nDr. W D. Brown, a busy man, who can confine a phone call to a per\nfunctory but kindly yes. no and a couple of suggestions.\nCharles Horn, the industrialist, is another fellow who can keep a\ntelephone working, but who has mastered the fine art of keeping the\nother fellow brief and to the point.\nTelephone calls at their best are not the moat rewarding to those\nwho like the people they try to serve Sunday afternoon and evening\nat the St. John's Day observance at Mount Olivet Baptist church we\nhad opportunity to see many of the subscribers to this paper and it\nwas truly a happy experience as it always is when we see so many\nof our people together. Nothing beats a warm handclasp and a Tm\nglad to see you.\u201d\nThere is seldom a more beautiful sight than the women of the\nEastern Star in their white dresses and regalia. They make a stun\nning picture and the rainbow beauty of the Negro-American ia never\nmore evident than in the women of the race.\nIt was our first visit to the completed Mount Olivet church. The\ncongregation should be proud of the edifice.\nThe scholarly pastor, Rev. B. H. Hunter gave a good sermon and\nwon much praise from the Prince Hall Masons and the Order of\nEastern Stars who heard his message. There were only five singers\nin the choir Sunday night directed by competent Silas M. Smith but\nthey sang beautifully and the listeners were enthralled by the sweet\nmusic.\nAs a choir director and soloist, this young man. Silas Smith, ia\nsomething to listen to and watch. He puts every bit of his soul into\nhia direction and voice. Charles D. Doty, grand master of the Masons\nseated on the platform, looked on in open eyed amazement as Smith\ncoaxed music and melody out of the throats of the choir. The\nplaying of the choir organist Bernice Cassell complemented the song\nefforts.\nNotes From The (\"uff: The air cooling units in the office of Fred\nOssanna.

This valor\ncommunicated itself to our\nfighting forces down to the laM\nman.\nThe conduct of the war hased\nItaelf upon a nation that trusted\nitself. We were brave.\nBUT a* our enemies sank\nunder our attacks new fears\narose.\nThey were cultivated and\nmagnified\nSome of them have already\nbeen proven groundless.\nFor example, we w ere advised\nthat although our armies were\nsweeping victoriously across\nnorthern Germany, Hitler had\norganized an unconquerable de\nfense redoubt\" over a great area\nin the Austrian and Bavarian\nAlps that it was fortifipd and\nstorked with the materials for a\nprolonged war. and that the\ngreatest and bloodiest resistance\nwould occur there\nThis elaborately developed\nfear was groundless\nThere was no such redoubt,\nand Berchtesgaden fell without\na struggle\nThen there was the fear of a\ndreadful underground \\a /1\nmovement that w ould keep Ger\n8-C\nTHI DETROIT TIMES\n4 \u2018the threats of any one nation to\nwithdraw unless she has her way in\nall matters where she feels she has a\ndirect, selfish interest.\u201d\nThe concessions already made to\nRussia at San Francisco clearly con\nstitute such a yielding.\n\u201cRUSSIA'S POLICIES IN EU\nROPE HAVE CONSTITUTED A\nDIRECT VIOLATION OF THE\nPLEDGES OF THE ATLANTIC\nCHARTER, TO WHICH SHE SUB\nSCRIBED\u201d the Wisconsin senator\nCharged.\n\u201cHer arbitrary policiet toward\nPoland conttitute clear-cut violation\nof the United Nationt pledget\nagaintt territorial changet which do\nnot accord with the freely expretted\nwithet of the people concerned . . .\n\u201cRuttia hat alto violated the At\nlantic Charter and the Yalta agree\nmentt in other areat liberated from\nthe Nazi yoke; in Romania, Bul\ngaria, Hungary and Auttria . . .\n\u201cIN SOME OF THESE AREAS\nTHERE HAS BEEN DOUBLE\nTALK ABOUT ELECTIONS IN\nTHE FUTURE , BUT PLEBI\nSCITES HELD AFTER PURGES,\nLIQUIDATIONS AND DEPORTA\nTIONS OF LIBERAL AND DEMO\nCRATIC FORCES ARE A HOL\nLOW MOCKERY OF THE VERY\nTENETS OF DEMOCRACY AS\nPRACTICED IN THE WORLD\nPRIOR TO THE ADVENT OF\nTOTALITARIANISM.\u201d\n* * *\nA WORLD charter envisioning\ninternational co operation for\npeaceful purposes cannot be a struc\nture of compromises with Russian\ndictatorship, oppression and enslave\nment.\nIt would surely fail of its pur\nposes, even if ratified by all the par\nticipating nations; and it would fail\nof ratification in the U. S. Senate, as\nSenator La Follette bluntly warns.\nThe San Francisco conference\nhas been well warned by Senator\nLa Follette that it must not make\nconcessions to Russia of such a\nnature, and so many of them, that,\nthe product of its labors will offend\nthe conscience of the civilized world\nand be wholly unacceptable to those\nnations of the world seeking a per\nmanent peace compatible with\nhuman dignity.\nmany in lawless tumult for a\ngreat while: that would wear\nihe force* of occupation down\nby assassination and attrition.\nThere were the \"werewolves\u2019\nand other mythological mon\nstrosities held up for our at\ntention.\nThese too, have proven to be\nimaginary.\nThe concept of guerilla war\nfore i\u00ab abhorent and foreign to\nthe (Verman mind. ,\nSome people are familiar with\nit and make ferocious guerillas,\nhut not the Germans, who are\never docile in the face of au\nthority.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nr PHK forrrmwit Nazi leaders\n-E have suicided, or are our\ncaptiv es\nIt seems doubtful that even\nthe most romantic impulses of\nthe German mind will trans\nform them into legendary\nheroes, nr that the Nazi party\nwill continue to plague us. and\nthe Germans, by an effective\nunderground organization.\nThey will not if we preserve\nour sense and act coolly, justly'\nand temperately to suppress\nthem\nA final fear with regard to\nGermany is now being built up\naround the danger of the his\ntoric general staff and the mili\ntary class.\nHaving utterly defeated the\nGerman armies, and having\nhrought Germany to prostra\ntion we still fear thnr militant\nspirit, and their capacity to or\nganize it again\nThere is some truth in this\nfe\u00abr but also a great deal of\nevaggeration.\nThe Germans have heen a\nwarlike people since their first\nemergency in history.\nThev attained their greatness\nbv armed strength\nAl< iei mans put their trust in\ntheir great general staff in its\nsuperior intelligence framed\n'k:!!. and elaborate planning\nv sy.

This was to\nhe the new rising political move\nment of the |x\u00bbtwar Canadian\nworld but it was nipped far\nbelow\u2019 ihe bud, and in fact,\nfrost-killed, when the people of\nindustrial Ontario iwhore labor\nis strong i cut its power last\nMonday to an insignificant six\nseats in a parliament of 90\nvot es.\nrpHIS Monday all Canada is\nA- furnishing another test of\nsocialism and you can check the\nresults tomorrow, hut if CCF\ncannot win in the British labor\ncenter of Ontario it cannot hope\nfor much anywhere outside the\nradical far west farming prov\ninces.\nThe war experience of people\nhas not been favorable to social\nism. The lack of competition\namong sellers has destroyed the\ninterests df the consumers to\nday, and government manage\nment has nowhere been satis\nfactory to the jieople.\n\u2022 \u2022 *\n/COMPETITION is the only\nthing which protects the\nconsumers, who are all the peo\nple. Government ownership and\noperation is as non-competitive\nas a trust, a cartel or a business\nmonopoly. Once any\u2019 single\nforce gets the power of exclu\nsive operation, ihe buyer must\naccept the terms Where rom\npetition is most active, the\nbuyer is best protected.\n('on>ider the service the pub\nlic gets on those western rail\nroads where some are bemoan\ning the parallel lines. It is much\nbetter than upon eastern roads\nwhich control a monopoly of\ntravel. This is true of the buy\ning of all goods or services. It\nis time of hotel accommodations,\nof buying cigarets, or renting a\nhouse or buying a dress.\nIf one fiower (government or\nprivate! owns all the business,\nor is in control of the operation\nfor any reason, ihe public inter\nests are not well served. Of\ncourse, they attribute our ex\nperiences to a shortage of goods\nor help. That is true, but the\neconomic effect has been the de\nstruction of competition. The\nconsumer could lie told w hat to\nbuy and at how much. He could\nnot get it across the street,\ncheaper or better.\n\u2022 \u2022 *\nIN MY opinion, government\nownership is in the public\ninterest only when it is in itself\ncompetitive competing with\nprivate interests to serve the\npublic better Consider the two\nCanadian railroads, one private\nand one government owned. The\npublic gets much better service\nthan if ihe government owned\nboth and railroading became a\nbusiness of government bureauc\nracy.\nTV A is good only when it can\nbe contrasted against a living\nprivate 'operation, because, if\nyou extend socialism to every\nthing, socialism itself becomes\na monopoly with all the de\nteriorating effects on the pub\nlic interest\nIf you extend socialism to a\nwhole country, you merely\ntransfer labor to a government\npay roll\u2014at government-fixed\nwages and by the elimina\ntion of comfiet it ion. allow\u2019 the\ngovernment to become the mo\nnopoly which offers you what\never service its political di\nrectors decide, under its terms.\nfOconomically socialism can\nnot generate business-like com\npetition. In a competitive econ\nomy. a great portion of business\ndevelops from the necessity of\none concern to get ahead of an\nother.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI SUSPECT Churchill (who\n1 was never much of a poli\ntician! may have seized upon\nthe most popular valid issue he\ncould present. The labor lead\ners who took up a proposal to\ngo \"halfway to communism\"\nhave certainly not chosen the\nbest lime to go in that direction\nfor popular effect.\nThere was Nazi socialism in\nGermany, so fresh .in all minds\nand so repugnant to all people.\nThen there is the socialism of\nRussia, covering all Stalin's in\ndustry (he uses communism\nonly for the farms) and this is\nnot popular in our labor. AFL\ncertainly is against it Look at\nthe differences in wage scales\nbetween Russia and United\nStates and you will see why.\nRecall ihe experience of labor\nnow in trying to get pay raises\nout of our government, and you\nwill appreciate why the work\ning man thinks be can get more\nout of a business man who is\nmaking a profit than out of a\ngovernment monopoly.\ns?

Inc.\nA TRUE \"dictatorship of the proletariat.\u201d even if demo\ncratic in form, if it undertook centrally to direct the\neconomic system, would probably DESTROY PERSONAL\nFREEDOM AS COMPLETELY AS ANY AUTOCRACY HAS\nEVER DONE.\nIndividual freedom cannot be reconciled with the suprem\nacy of one single purpose to which the whole of society is\npermanently subordinated.\nTo a limited extent we ourselves experience this fact in\nwartime, when subordination of almost everything to the im\nmediate and pressing need is the price at which we preserve\nour freedom in the long run.\nThe fashionable phrases about doing for the pur\nposes of peace what we have learned to do for the\npurposes of war are completely misleading, for it is\nsensible temporarily to sacrifice freedom in order to\nmake it more secure in the future, but it is quite a dif\nferent thing to sacrifice liberty permanently in the in\nterests of a planned economy.\nTo those who have watched the transition from socialism\nto fascism at close quarters, the CONNECTION BETWEEN\nTHE TWO SYSTEMS IS OBVIOUS.\nThe realization of the Socialist program means the\nDESTRUCTION OF FREEDOM. Democratic socialism, the\ngreat Utopia of the last few generations, is simply NOT\nACHIEVABLE.\nWhy the Worst Get on Top\nNo doubt an American or English \"Fascist\u201d system would\ndiffer greatly from the Italian or German models; no doubt,\nif the transition were effected without violence, we might\nexpect to get a better type of leader.\nYet this docs not mean our Fascist system would in the\nend prove very different or MUCH LESS INTOLERABLE\nthan its prototypes.\nThere are strong reasons for believing that the\nworst features of the totalitarian systems are phenom\nena which totalitarianism is certain sooner or later to\nproduce.\nJust as the democratic statesman who sets out to plan\neconomic life will soon be confronted with the alternative of\nEITHER ASSUMING DICTATORIAL POWERS OR ABAN\nDONING HIS PLANS, so the totalitarian leader would soon\nhave to CHOOSE BETWEEN DISREGARD OF ORDINARY\nMORALS AND FAILURE.\nIt is for this reason that the unscrupulous are likely to be\nmore successful in a society tending toward totalitarianism.\nWho does not see this has not yet grasped the full width of\nthe gulf which separates totalitarianism from the essentially\nindividualist western * civilization.\n*> * \u00ab\nTHE totalitarian leader must collect around him a group\nwhich is prepared voluntarily to submit to that discipline\n* which they are to impose by force upon the rest of the people.\nThat socialism can be put into practice only by methods\nwhich most Socialists disapprove is, of course, a lesson learned\nby many social reformers in the past.\nThe old Socialist parties were inhibited by their\ndemocratic ideals; they did not possess the ruthless\nness required for the performance of their chosen task.\nIt is characteristic that both in Germany and in Italy\nthe success of fascism was preceded Wy the REFUSAL OF THE\nSOCIALIST PARTIES TO TAKE OVER THE RESPONSI\nBILITIES OF GOVERNMENT.\nThey were unwilling wholeheartedly to employ the meth\nods to which they had pointed the way. They still hoped for\nthe miracle of a majority\u2019s agreeing on a particular plan for\nthe organization of the whole of society.\nOthers had already learned the lesson that in a planned\nsociety the question can no longer be nn what do a majority\n| of the people agree but WHAT THE LARGEST SINGLE\nGROUP IS whose members agree sufficiently to make unified\ndirection of all affairs possible.\n\u2666\u2666 # 0\nriNHERE are three main reasons why such a numerous group,\n1 with fairly similar views, is not likely to he formed by the best\nbut rather by the WORST ELEMENTS of any society.\nFirst, the higher the education and intelligence of indi\nviduals become, the more their tastes and views are dif\nferentiated.\nIf we wish to find a high degree of uniformity in outlook,\nwe have to descend to the regions of lower moral and intellec\ntual standards where the more primitive instincts prevail.\nThis does not mean that the majority of people have low\nmoral standards; it merely means that the LARGEST GROUP\nof people whose values are very similar are the people with\nLOW STANDARDS.\nSecond, since this group is not large enough to give suf\nficient weight to the leader s endeavors, he will have to in\ncrease their numbers by converting more to the same simple\ncreed.\nHe must gain the support of the docile and gullible, who\nhave NO STRONG CONVICTIONS OF THEIR OWN but are\nready to accept a ready-made system of value if it is only\nDRUMMED INTO THEIR EARS SUFFICIENTLY LOUDLY\nAND FREQUENTLY.\nIt will be those whose vague and imperfectly formed\nideas are easily swayed and whose passions and emotions are\nreadily aroused who will thus swell the ranks of the totali\ntarian party.\nThird, to weld together a closely coherent body of sup.\nporters, the leader must appeal to a common human weakness.\nIt seems to be easier for people to agree on a\nNEGATIVE PROGRAM\u2014on the hatred of an enemy,\non the envy of those better off\u2014than on any positive\ntask.\nThe contrast between the \"we\u201d and the \"they\u201d is con\nsequently always employed by those who seek the allegiance\nof huge masses. The enemy may be internal, like the \"Jew\u201d\nin Germany or the \"Kulak\u201d in Russia, or he may be external.\nIn any case, this technique has the great advantage of\nleaving the leader greater freedom than would almost any\npositive program.\n# # *\nADVANCEMENT within a totalitarian group or party de\npends largely on a willingness to do immoral things.\nThe principle that the end justifies the means, which in\nindividualist ethics is regarded as the denial of all morals,\nin collectivist ethics BECOMES NECESSARILY THE SU\nPREME ruleA\nThere is literally nothing which the consistent collectivist\nmust not be prepared to do if it serves \"the good of the whole,\u201d\nbecause that is to him the only criterion of what ought to\nbe done.\nOnce you admit that the individual is merely a\nmeans to serve the ends of the higher entity cqlled\nsociety or the nation, most of those features of totali\ntarianism which horrify us follow of necessity.\nFrom th# collectivist standpoint intolerance and brutal\nsuppression of dissent, deception and spying, the complete dis\nregard of the life and happiness of the individual are essen\ntial and unavoidable. Acts which revolt all our feelings, such '\nas the shooting of hostages or the killing of the old or sick, %\nare treated as mere matters of expediency; the compulsory!\nuprooting and transportation of hundreds of thousands be\ncomes an instrument of policy approved by almost everybody\nexcept the victims.\n# \u00ab #\nTO BE a useful assistant in the running of a totalitarian\nstate, therefore, a man must be prepared to break every\nmoral rule he has ever known if this seems necessary t\u00bb\nachieve the end set for him.\nIn the totalitarian machine there will be special opportunl- |\ntics for the ruthless and unscrupulous.\nNeffher the gesta|K> nor the administration of a concen\ntration camp, neither the ministry of propaganda nor the SA\nor SS (or their Russian counterparts) are suitable places for\nthe exercise of humanitarian feelings.\nYET IT IS THROUGH SUCH POSITIONS THAT THE\nROAD TO THE HIGHEST POSITIONS IN THE TOTALI\nTARIAN STATE LEADS.\nA distinguished American economist, Prof. Frank H.\nKnight, correctly notes that the authorities of a collectivist \u2022\nstate \u201cwould ha\\e to do these things whether they wanted to\nor not: and the probability of the people in power being Indi\n\\idtials who would dislike the possession and exercise of power\nis on a level with the probability that an extremely tender\nhearted person would get the job of whirling master in a\nslave plantation.\"\nA further point should be made here;\nCollectivism means the end of truth.\nTo make a totalitarian system function efficiently, it is\nnot enough that everybody should be forced to work for the\nends selected by those in control; IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT\nTHE PEOPLE SHOULD COME TO REGARD THESE ENDS\nAS THEIR OWN. This is brought about by propaganda and\nby complete control of all sources of information.\n(To Ite Continued)\nPait Malloy\nYI T ASI IINGTON.

BENSON\n| BEAS President of Harding Celloge\n|| B\n.i ;\n1 A few years ago a national organization made an (mini()n\u2018\n} poll of newspaper editorial writers to obtain their attitudes on\n| & number of economic questions, The writers were asked il'l\n\u2018:thu_v_ I:l\\<:.x'v.d' certain measures of legislation affecting eco\n[ nomic activities within the nation. And at the end of the list\n| of questions was this one: \u201cWould it be advisable to adopt\n| Socialism as an economic system for America?\u201d\n(\" An overwhelming number of the editorial writers partiei\n| pating in the survey said \u201cNo\u201d to the last question they\n[ registered themselves as opposed to Socialism for America.\n! l.\u2018ut_sur_\u2018]).risingly enough, a substantial number of them favor\nled individual legislative measures taken directly from the\n| textbook of Soecialism. In other words, thev thought they\n| were opposed to Socialism, but when Socialism\u2019s economic\n| program was broken down into separate measfires not\nlabeled as Socialist they registered approval of some of\nits vital parts.\nThis opinion survey revealed two important dangers: (1)\nMany influential people in America do not understand the eco\nnomic facts of life, and (2) The real danger of Socialism to\n| America is its insidious, unrecognized advance. 1 recently\nheard a politician of one of the major parties accuse his op\nponent of \u201ccrying Socialism\u201d about a legislative measure that |\nlater was enacted. He said his opponent now was \u201ccrying\u2018\nSocialism\u201d about a newly proposed measure. ' i\nThe opponent was correct; both measures are based on/\n[the economic philosophy of the Socialist economic platform\nas printed on page 145 of my copy of the Communist Mani-,\nfesto. Their adoption by our largely Capitalistic nation doesn\u2019t\n\u2018ullm' their true identity or their nature. In fact, in modern '\ntimes, Marxist Socialist party leaders throughout the world !\nIhn\\ e taught their followers to disguise Socialism to ad-'\nvance it bit by bit under such labels as \u201cliberal,\u201d \u201cprogressive,\u201d\n\u201chumanitarian.\u201d These Communist and Socialist tactics em-|\nphasize the need for every American citizen to clearly, under-|\nstand the economic facts of life. '\nA new book on economics has come to my attention. It is\u2019\nI entitled, \u201cCommon-Sense Economics.\u201d This is exactly what wei\n] need in the whole realm of economics common sense writ-,\ning and common sense appraisal. This new book was written |\nj by Gilbert M. Tucker of Albany, New York, and is published |\nby The Stackpole Company, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania!\n' (34.95). Gilbert Tucker is a friend of mine. I have found him |\nto be a man of sound logie, and his book reflects a great talent |\nfor clarity as well as an entertaining sense of humor. i\nSo far as is humanly possible, he has tried to present the!\neconomic facts of life devoid of the jargon and the seemingly |\n| endless dog-after-his-tail involvements of the classic academic\n{ economist. He has gone far toward achieving in this goal.l\nlHis book is readable. |\nl Most of the best informed tax experts are agreed that longi\n! overdue tax reform must now be considered a \u201cmust\u201d for sz\u2018.f('-%\n{g\u2018ia;u'(iin,: our nation.

It\ndates back to when he was 39\nyears old and the newly elected\nGovernor of Virginia.\nHe refused to be a \u201csilk hat\nHarry,\u201d wore a derby to his in\nauguration, and has been trying to\ncut public spending ever since.\nHe succeeded well in this as\nGovernor\u2014turning a deficit into\na surplus before he left that\noffice.\nIn the Senate, he admits it has\nbeen an up-hill fight.\n\u201cBut I feel with all the sincerity\nof which I am capable,\u201d he said\nin an interview, \"that a con\ntinuation of New Deal and Fair\nDeal policies to their ultimate\nconclusion will destroy the sol\nvency of our democracy and lead\nus to a state of socialism which\nwill destroy the liberties of our\npeople.\u201d \u2022\nNot Discouraged.\nHis fight, he said, has put mm\nin \u201cthe shadow of Presidential\ndispleasure for 17 Vi of the 18\nyears I\u2019ve been here although the\nPresidents have been of the Dem\nocratic Party.\u201d\nThere are times \u2014 \"unpleasant\ntimes\u201d\u2014when he feels that he is\naccomplishing little.\n\u201cBut I haven\u2019t become discour\naged,\u201d he added, rising to pace\nslowly near his desk.\n\"I haven\u2019t become discouraged\nbecause I believe it is necessary\nto have sincere opposition to a\nrising tide of what I believe to be\nState socialism and squandering\nof the people\u2019s money.\u201d\nWith the people back home, he\nadded, there is \u201cmore definite\nsentiment for a cut in non-defense\nspending than there has been for\na long time.\u201d\nMotto for Senators.\nAnd it was only last week that\na quotation from a speech by\nSenator Byrd was sent as a\n\u201cmotto\u201d to each of the other Sen\nators by Senator Johnson (Demo\ncrat of Colorado).\nSenator Johnson thought so\nmuch of the quotation that he had\nit printed on parchment \u201cfor\nframing as a wall, motto.\u201d\nThe quotation:\n\u201cThe test of my vote in the\nSenate and my actions elsewhere,\nnow as they have been in the past\nand as they shall be in the fu\nture. are determined by what in\nSENATOR BYRD.\nmy conscience I believe to be the\nbest for my country.\n\u201cI say with all the sincerity of\nwhich I am capable that such a\ntest must be applied to everything\nby everybody in this country for\na long time to come if we are to\nrestore peace and freedom for\nwhich this Nation was founded\nand to which it is dedicated.\u201d\nSenator Byrd, recalling some of\nhis 18 years in the Senate, said\nhe supported President Roosevelt\nso long as \"he stood on his plat\nform of 1932.\u201d\nSenator Byrd added that Mr.\nRoosevelt \"left his platform six\nmonths after he was elected.\u201d\nApyic uiuniug ms huumji\nSince then Senator Byrd has\nbeen at outs with the White\nHouse.\n\u201cAs a consequence,\u201d he said, \"I\nam probably the only Senator who\nhas been invited to the White\nHouse for a dinner only once in\n18 years.\u201d\nSenator Byrd emphasized, how\never, that \u201cI have supported both\nMr. Roosevelt and Mr. Truman as\na member of the Armed Services\nCommittee in all measures for na\ntional defense and in vigorous\nprosecution of the two wars we\nhave been engaged in.\u201d\nWhen he is not spending long\nhours at work as a Senator, he\nseeks out his hobby of seeing\nthings grow\u2014especially apples.\nHis earliest ambition was to be\nan apple grower. He succeeded in\nthat very well by becoming the\nlargest apple grower in the world.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great pleasure to me to\nplant young orchards,\u201d he said,\n\u201cand then see them grow to ma\nturity.
