    "`pandas` is a Python library that provides a couple new data structures that give users much more flexibility when reading in or exporting data. The main way that we will interact with `pandas` is through the pre-defined `DataFrame` object. `DataFrame`s are a very different data structure than what you may be used to from this class or other classes. It is most similar to a SQL database or an Excel spreadsheet in that it expects 'tabular data' (data that can be arranged in a table). \n",
    "\n",
    "`pandas` is very unique in that it is not just written in Python but also an intermediate language between C and Python called `Cython`. This feature means that `pandas` has all of the ease of a Python library, while also utilizing all of the speed and efficiency of C. Thus, `pandas` has become a critical component in data science, data analytics and, of course, natural language process and the digital humanities. "
