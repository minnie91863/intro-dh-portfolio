    "`pandas` is a Python library that provides a couple new data structures that give users much more flexibility when reading in or exporting data. The main way that we will interact with `pandas` is through the pre-defined `DataFrame` object. `DataFrame`s are a very different data structure than what you may be used to from this class or other classes. It is most similar to a SQL database or an Excel spreadsheet in that it expects 'tabular data' (data that can be arranged in a table). \n",

    "`pandas` is very unique in that it is not just written in Python but also an intermediate language between C and Python called `Cython`. This feature means that `pandas` has all of the ease of a Python library, while also utilizing all of the speed and efficiency of C. Thus, `pandas` has become a critical component in data science, data analytics and, of course, natural language process and the digital humanities. "

    "Nothing is a substitute for learning regex, but I find it difficult to introduce to students because it has a high learning curving. This website: https://www.autoregex.xyz/ is a great tool to get started with regex. It uses state of the art sentence transformers (something we may learn about at the very end of this course) to convert an English prompt into a regular expression. Let's try it now for selecting all of the text between square brackets. "
